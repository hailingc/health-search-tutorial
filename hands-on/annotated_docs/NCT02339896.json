{"text": "TITLE:\n      Observation Study an Immunogenicity Modified TRC-ID Regimen With CPRV With or Without Rabies Immunoglobulin in Children\nSUMMARY:\n      To determine Immunogenicity and Safety Study of Modified TRC-ID Regimen with A New\n      Chromatographically Purified Vero Cell Rabies Vaccine (SPEEDA\u00ae) as post exposure rabies\n      intradermal regimen with or without Rabies Immunoglobulin in Children\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      post exposure rabies vaccination with modified Thai red cross intrademal regimen has been\n      proven to be immunogenic and effection when using purified vero cell vaccine (PVRV) In\n      present, new chromatographically purified vero cell rabies vaccine (SPEEDA), chromatography\n      purifed vero cell derived rabies vaccine, is manufactured by the Liaoning Chengda\n      Biotechnology is available This study has a goal to determine the immunogenicity of speeda\n      when using with post exposure rabies intradermal vaccination with or without rabies immune\n      globulin in children\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  they are 1-15 years healthy children\n          -  give signed

Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  they have prior history of rabies vaccination or any equine/human serum\n             administration such as snake antivenom and tetanus antiserum or vaccine allergy\n          -  Persons who have immunosuppressive conditions such as known HIV infection,\n             transplantation, chronic renal failure, receiving of steroid or immunosuppressive\n             drugs\n          -  person received anti-malarial drugs within the previous two months or any blood\n             products within previous three months were excluded\n          -  Urine pregnancy test must be done in all female adolescents to exclude the pregnancy\n             in first visit\n", "cuis": "C0021027 C0202081 C0481219 C0202083 C2825347 C0020843 C0577612 C0202086
