{"text": "TITLE:\n      Role of Dairy Products in Weight Maintenance\nSUMMARY:\n      The goal of the current study is to determine the role of dairy in similarly preventing\n      weight and fat re-gain in obese adults who have successfully completed a weight loss diet\n      program.240 obese subjects will undergo a meal-replacement-based weight loss plan designed\n      to produce a 10 kg weight loss in 8-12 weeks. Upon achieving the weight loss goal, subjects\n      will be randomly assigned to either a low-dairy or high-dairy eucaloric weight maintenance\n      diet for two years. Macronutrient distribution will be maintained constant and set at\n      approximately the U.S. average. Primary outcomes include changes in body weight, body fat\n      and anatomical distribution of fat (via dual x-ray absorptiometry) and resting metabolic\n      rate and substrate oxidation (via respiratory calorimetry); Secondary outcomes include blood\n      pressure, circulating glucose, insulin, lipids and calcitrophic hormones. on prevention of\n      weight regain in humans has not yet been assessed in clinical trials.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Dietary calcium plays a pivotal role in the regulation of energy metabolism, as we have\n      found high calcium diets to attenuate adipocyte lipid accretion and weight gain during\n      periods of over-consumption of an energy-dense diet and to increase lipolysis and preserve\n      thermogenesis during caloric restriction, thereby markedly accelerating weight loss. Our\n      studies of the agouti gene demonstrate a key role for intracellular Ca2+ in regulating\n      adipocyte lipid metabolism and triglyceride storage, with increased intracellular Ca2+\n      resulting in stimulation of lipogenic gene expression and lipogenesis and suppression of\n      lipolysis, resulting in adipocyte lipid filling and increased adiposity. Moreover, the\n      increased calcitriol produced in response to low calcium diets stimulates adipocyte Ca2+\n      influx and, consequently, promotes adiposity, while higher calcium diets inhibit\n      lipogenesis, promote lipolysis, lipid oxidation and thermogenesis and inhibit diet-induced\n      obesity in mice. Notably, dairy sources of calcium exert markedly greater effects in\n      attenuating weight and fat gain and accelerating fat loss. This augmented effect of dairy\n      products versus supplemental calcium is likely due to additional bioactive compounds in\n      dairy which act synergistically with calcium to attenuate adiposity. These concepts are\n      confirmed by both epidemiological and clinical data which demonstrates that increasing\n      dietary calcium results in significant reductions in adipose tissue mass in obese humans in\n      the absence of caloric restriction and markedly accelerates the weight and body fat loss\n      secondary to caloric restriction, while dairy products exert markedly greater (nearly\n      two-fold compared to calcium supplements) effects. These data indicate an important role for\n      dairy products in both the prevention and treatment of obesity. However, weight maintenance\n      following successful weight loss (i.e. prevention of regain) is at least as important as\n      strategies to initially achieve weight loss, as most individuals who successfully lose\n      weight are not successful in maintaining this weight loss. We have recently demonstrated\n      that ad libitum re-feeding of dairy-rich following weight loss in mice on an energy\n      restricted mice prevented the suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis and fat oxidation that\n      otherwise accompanies such re-feeding and markedly upregulated skeletal muscle fat\n      oxidation. Consequently, although animals re-fed low calcium diets rapidly regained all of\n      the weight and fat that had been lost, animals fed high calcium diets exhibited a shift in\n      energy partitioning and a 50-85% reduction in weight and fat gain; moreover, dairy exerted\n      markedly greater effects than supplemental calcium on weight and fat regain. However, the\n      effect of dairy on prevention of weight regain in humans has not yet been assessed in\n      clinical trials. Accordingly, the goal of the current study is to determine the role of\n      dairy in similarly preventing weight and fat re-gain in obese adults who have successfully\n      completed a weight loss diet program.\n      340 obese subjects will undergo a meal-replacement-based weight loss plan designed to\n      produce a 10 kg weight loss in 8-12 weeks. Upon achieving the weight loss goal, subjects\n      will be randomly assigned to either a low-dairy or high-dairy eucaloric weight maintenance\n      diet for two years. Macronutrient distribution will be maintained constant and set at\n      approximately the U.S. average. Primary outcomes include changes in body weight, body fat\n      and anatomical distribution of fat (via dual x-ray absorptiometry) and resting metabolic\n      rate and substrate oxidation (via respiratory calorimetry); Secondary outcomes include blood\n      pressure, circulating glucose, insulin, lipids and calcitrophic hormones.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Body mass index (BMI) 30-39.9 kg/m2\n          -  Age 25-50 years\n          -  No more than 3 kg weight loss during past three months\n          -  Negative pregnancy test at entry; women of childbearing potential may be enrolled if\n             they have had a tubal ligation or use one of the following means of contraception:\n             condom, diaphragm, oral or implanted contraceptives, or intrauterine device.
