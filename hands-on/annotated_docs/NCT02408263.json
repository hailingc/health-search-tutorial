{"text": "TITLE:\n      Electrical Skin Conductance Monitoring as an Assessment of Post Operative Pain Scores\nSUMMARY:\n      Pain has been defined as a subjective experience. Various pain assessment tools, (such as\n      NRS) have been developed and validated to objectively monitor and treat pain. There are\n      certain patient populations, in whom, the current pain assessment tools cannot be used\n      effectively due to communication problems such as cognitively impaired patients. In the US,\n      the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has made it\n      mandatory to monitor and treat pain. In the absence of reliable pain assessment tools that\n      would objectively measure pain, there is also risk of under treatment and overtreatment of\n      pain that may lead to negative outcomes. Therefore, a monitor that is able to predict pain\n      levels objectively, will help to achieve above goals. The investigators are using Skin\n      Conductance Algesimeter (SCA) to measure pain by analyzing changes in skin conductance.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients undergoing unilateral THR and TKR who are between the ages of 18 and 85\n             regardless of the anesthesia and postoperative analgesia type.\n          -  Patients participating in other studies may participate in this study as well\n          -  Patients with Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MAAS) Score of 3 and 4\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Age <18, >85\n          -  History of chronic pain as defined by use of long acting opioid medication > 6 months\n             duration.\n          -  MAAS Score of <3 and >4.\n          -  Anticholinergic agent use\n          -  Patients with the following conditions:\n        Autonomic neuropathy\n          -  Pacemaker/AICD\n          -  Burn patients or patients with severe dermatologic conditions (as defined by skin\n             conditions causing further pain to patients that actively has to be treated)\n          -  Allergy to adhesive tape\n          -  Communication barriers\n          -  Bilateral Procedures\n          -  Patient with diagnosis of\n          -  Dysautonomia\n          -  Sympathetic dysfunction such as: Raynaud disease, Buerger disease\n          -  Disorders of sweating such as: Acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis\n", "cuis": "C0150369 C1283169 C0026426 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1261322 C2826217 C0178298 C0444099 C0496955 C1546781 C0030193 C1882272 C2598155 C4050231 C1552616 C1706244 C0030198 C0558035 C2266644 C2979880 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0440102 C0030193 C1882272 C2598155 C0015733 C0183622 C0489144 C0030695 C0150369 C0181904 C0030193 C0018017 C2239270 C2363670 C1328018 C0030198 C0558035 C0015733 C0183622 C0489144 C0087130 C2364293 C0481701 C0086388 C0029237 C1552679 C0030198 C0558035 C3858758 C0030695 C0150369 C0181904 C0030193 C0424530 C1554132 C1619643 C0015733 C0183622 C0489144 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0030193 C4046039 C0018017 C2239270 C0030695 C0150369 C0181904 C0030193 C1442948 C1299581 C1513916 C0018017 C0679840 C1552861 C0178298 C0444099 C0496955 C1546781 C2239270 C2955947 C0030193 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0040005 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0853389 C0002903 C0278134 C2219802 C1507243 C2926599 C4049933 C0733886 C0576657 C0022701 C0233778 C2721568 C0947630 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1261322 C2826217 C0600075 C3668946 C4049938 C0175659 C0222045 C0349674 C0684254 C4050231 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0243161 C1114365 C0150055 C0744939 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C0262926 C2004062 C0242402 C1561542 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C4050231 C0242896 C0242893 C3537004 C0012634 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0259749 C0030163 C1546728 C3853703 C0810633 C0972395 C0006434 C0719044 C1546564 C1550619 C1962979 C0037274 C1306232 C0030695 C1314212 C0030678 C0017313 C0025102 C0204659 C0451610 C0747307 C0848894 C0030193 C0012634 C0332155 C1635164 C0183828 C1706912 C0007294 C0184661 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0025664 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0013363 C0034734 C0040021 C0012634 C0018609 C0277785 C0003028 C0038990 C0012634 C3245488 ", "concepts": "monitoring, Monitoring, Monitoring;BP, assessment, Assessment, Assessment, assessment, No Assessment, Skin, Skin, Skin, Skin, Pain, Pain, Pain, Score summary, summary pain assessment, Skin assessment, subjective, Subjective, experience, experience, Inexperience, Various, Pain, Pain, Pain, stools, Stools, Stools monitor, monitor, monitor, pain, objectives, objective, developer, Therex pain assessment, Skin assessment, stools, Stools, Stools, Uncertain problems communication, communication;
