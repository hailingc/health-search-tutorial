{"text": "TITLE:\n      Pharmacodynamic Study of Carvedilol Versus Metoprolol in Heart Failure\nSUMMARY:\n      Metoprolol succinate is a beta1-selective beta-blocker, becoming non-selective at higher\n      doses, while carvedilol is non-selective. We examined whether metoprolol remained\n      beta1-selective compared to carvedilol during dose up-titration in Class C heart failure\n      (HF) Beta-blocker na\u00efve patients.\n      METHODS: Twenty-five NYHA FC II-III HF patients were randomized to carvedilol or metoprolol.\n      Patients were studied at baseline and after 2 weeks of up-titration (metoprolol at 25, 50,\n      100, and 200 mg daily; carvedilol IR at 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 mg and 50mg twice daily).\n      Beta2- blockade was determined by an infusion of terbutaline at 6 mg/kg over 1 hour. Glucose\n      and potassium levels were serially measured at baseline, every 15 minutes for the 1st hour\n      and 30 minutes for 2nd hour post-infusion. The median area under the curve (AUC) for glucose\n      and potassium changes were calculated.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients eligible for the study had objective evidence of systolic dysfunction\n             (ejection fraction \u226440%), were >18 years of age, and were on stable optimal medical\n             heart failure therapy excluding the use of beta-blockers within the previous 30 days.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  . Patients were excluded for active viral myocarditis; hemodynamically significant\n             valvular heart disease; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy;\n             contra-indications to beta-blockers (asthma or obstructive airway disease requiring\n             scheduled bronchodilators or inhaled steroids), resting heart rate <55; supine blood\n             pressure <85/50; second or third degree heart block); concomitant use of\n             beta-agonists, beta-antagonists, or anti-arrhythmics; unstable angina; myocardial\n             infarction or bypass surgery within 3 months; or significant renal insufficiency\n             (creatinine >2.5 mg/dL), liver disease (transaminase levels > 3 fold above laboratory\n             normal), or anemia.\n", "cuis": "C0018801 C0018802 C0054836 C0025859 C0947630 C1552616 C1706244 C0724633 C0001645 C0054836 C0025859 C0332128 C0000589 C0025638 C0018801 C0018802 C0054836 C0162621 C0456387 C0001645 C0054836 C0025859 C0025663 C0025664 C0025859 C0162621 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0728774 C0054836 C0039542 C0574032 C0854643 C0017725 C0337438 C0374429 C3540676 C0202194 C0302353 C0428289 C1446030 C0886384 C3840931 C0728774 C0574032 C0854643 C0017725 C3845578 C1443182 C1441792 C0721171 C0202194 C0304475 C0597277 C0303276 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0749225 C0520863 C1847397 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0947630 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0489482 C2020641 C2700378 C0743400 C1545667 C0180980 C0056085 C0018801 C0018802 C0087111 C0033972 C0001645 C3842337 C0243161 C0276138 C0276163 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552867 C1320102 C0007194 C1842173 C0348615 C3532248 C0685102 C0685103 C3665332 C1835461 C0949658 C0340434 C2047602 C2919646 C0877208 C0269972 C2063813 C0018824 C1963123 C2064629 C0600260 C0024117 C0004096 C0001645 C2065041 C0586793 C0006280 C0604799 C0018810 C2041121 C2197023 C0488794 C3845990 C0005768 C0229664 C0086960 C0151517 C0264906 C0460139 C0003195 C3537142 C0002965 C0340288 C0243192 C2987634 C0381385 C1565489 C0001623 C1963059 C0405580 C0035078 C3267129 C3809739 C0022660 C1565662 C0342475 C0021308 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0741847 C1561542 C0023895 C2186532 C3280432 C0455417 C0919834 C0729000 C0201975 C1561535 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C1553386 C0002871 ", "concepts": "Heart Failure, Heart Failure, Carvedilol, Metoprolol, Study summary, summary Metoprolol succinate, beta-blocker carvedilol, metoprolol, Examined, Mexamine, Hexamine heart failures, Heart failure, carvedilol, titration, Class Beta-blocker carvedilol, metoprolol, methods, methods metoprolol, titration, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Vaseline carvedilol terbutaline, infusion, Reinfusion, D-Glucose, Glucose, Eeg over 1 hour, Blockade potassium levels, potassium level, potassium level, CSF potassium level, 5 minutes, 11-15 minutes, Vaseline infusion, Reinfusion, glucose, 16-30 minutes Calculated, US.calculated, potassium k, Potassium, Potassium, Potassium, potassium 40 criteria, Eligibility Criteria systolic dysfunction, Diastolic dysfunction, Global systolic dysfunction, Objective, objective, Objective, study, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient ejection fraction (EF), ejection fraction, Ejection fraction, Ejection fraction low, Views ejection fraction, Traction frame, Cohn fraction I heart failures, Heart failure, therapy, Cotherapy, beta-blocker, 0 days Criteria viral myocarditis, Adenoviral myocarditis, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, exclude, Factive HCM - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, No hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, [X]Other hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Foetal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Canine hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (20%), familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Dystrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy gene MYL3, Secondary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, Postpartum cardiomyopathy, postpartum cardiomyopathy, valvular heart diseases, Valvular heart disease, primary valvular heart disease obstructive airway disease, Chronic obstructive airway disease, asthma, beta-blocker inhaled steroids, inhaled steroids use, bronchodilators, bronchodilat, Heart rate, heart rate, heart rate, Heart rate, No heart rate, blood, blood, schedule 3rd degree heart block, 2nd degree heart block, pressure Anti-arrhythmic, Anti-arrhythmic, unstable angina, stable angina, agonists, agonist, antagonist G renal insufficiencies, Adrenal insufficiency, NOS, Adrenal insufficiency, Adrenal insufficiency NOS, Renal insufficiency, Prerenal insufficiency, No adrenal insufficiency, acute renal insufficiency, Acute renal insufficiency, Adrenal insufficiency NEC, infarction, surgery, surgery, surgery:, bypass, month liver diseases of, liver disease, No liver disease, FH: liver disease, transaminases, transamin, Creatinine, Creatinine, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory normal, anemia "}
