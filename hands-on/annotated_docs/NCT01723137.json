{"text": "TITLE:\n      Measuring Changes in Acute Pain in the Emergency Department Using Patient Reported Scales\nSUMMARY:\n      Patient reported pain, stress, and anxiety measures have been found to be inter-related, but\n      it is not known if they are all associated with receiving opiate medications. The objective\n      of this study is to determine if patients' degree of reported pain, stress, or anxiety is\n      associated with receiving opiate pain medications in the emergency department or at\n      discharge. Alert patients at least 18 years of age and who report pain greater than 3/10 are\n      eligible to participate in the study. Consenting patients complete Visual Analog Scales\n      describing their perceived pain, stress, and anxiety from enrollment until discharge.\n      Demographic data and administration of pain medication is also recorded. Visual Analog Scale\n      scores among patients who received an opioid pain medicine in the emergency department and\n      at discharge will be compared to those who did not.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Reported pain greater than or equal to 3 out of 10\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Less than 18 years of age\n          -  Decreased level of consciousness\n          -  Inability to answer questions\n          -  Prisoner\n", "cuis": "C0184567 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0684224 C0700287 C1522485 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0175659 C0222045 C0349674 C0699270 C1552616 C1706244 C0747307 C0003467 C0860603 C0038435 C0030193 C0233492 C0445356 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0376196 C0242401 C3845898 C0700287 C1549114 C0684224 C0003467 C0860603 C0542560 C0038435 C0947630 C0030193 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0376196 C0242401 C0030193 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C0684224 C0700287 C0718338 C3669039 C0030193 C3536884 C0947630 C1815293 C3888021 C1516879 C0030971 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C0003467 C0860603 C0038435 C0030193 C0278329 C3536884 C0002771 C0849174 C1533734 C0376495 C0199808 C0199810 C0725057 C1536282 C0001563 C0036589 C0150270 C3469597 C3245479 C0182913 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0242402 C0030193 C0013227 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0518088 C0243161 C1821572 C1562529 C0508431 C0731271 ", "concepts": "Acute Pain, Emergency, Emergency, emergency, emergency, Emergency OB, Reported, reported, Reporter, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Scale, Scale, Scale, Measurin summary, summary Patient reported, anxiety, anxiety, stress, pain, elated, Unrelated medications, medications:, Medications, Medications, medication:, Premedications, Objective, objective, Objective, opiates, opiates, Uknown Reported, Unreported, Reported, anxiety, anxiety, degree, stress, study, pain medications, medications:, Medications, Medications, medication:, Premedications, emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, opiates, opiates, pain Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, reports, reports, Alert, Alert, pain Visual Analog Scales, study, Complete enrollment, Enrollment, perceived, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, anxiety, anxiety, stress, pain, prescribing Visual Analog Scale, pain medication, skin medication, administration, Readministration, Dpt administration, Mmr administration, administration sets, Maladministrations, oral administration, self administration, Drug administration, drug administration, data, recorder emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, opioid, pain, Medicine Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge criteria, Eligibility Criteria Reported pain Criteria Decreased level of consciousness (finding), O/E - decreased level of consciousness answer questions nerisone "}
