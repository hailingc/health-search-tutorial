{"text": "TITLE:\n      Case Management Alternatives for African American Women at High Risk for HIV\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to test two innovative case management approaches designed to\n      increase linkages and engagement with drug abuse treatment, HIV-related care, and other\n      health services among an underserved population of African American women at risk for HIV.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The study is fundamentally concerned with the implementation and evaluation of\n      theoretically-based, culturally appropriate case management interventions targeting\n      individual, social and environmental factors among highly vulnerable African American women.\n      The research is designed to test innovative, comprehensive approaches to HIV\n      prevention/intervention through case management driven service linkage and engagement.\n      Testing new approaches to intervention with African-American women at high risk for HIV\n      addresses a particularly urgent public health need in Miami, as well as other large\n      metropolitan areas, where officials continue to document epidemic rates of HIV/AIDS\n      clustered in urban, impoverished African-American communities.\n      Comparison: Participants will be randomly assigned to: a Strengths-Based / Professional Only\n      Condition in which clients participate in a \"strengths-based\" case management approach; or,\n      a Strengths-Based / Professional/Peer Condition in which a team composed of: a) a\n      credentialed, professional case manager and b) a recovering addict peer - both trained in\n      \"strengths-based\" case management techniques - develop and facilitate the implementation of\n      a service plan.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Current substance abuse\n          -  Current high-risk sexual behavior\n          -  African American racial identification\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Non resident of Miami-Dade county\n", "cuis": "C0085971 C0376636 C3272283 C4050568 C2097317 C1552616 C1706244 C0085971 C1145359 C1444476 C1444479 C0376636 C0947630 C0392366 C0456984 C0425152 C2937292 C0013146 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0580931 C0233492 C0445356 C0018747 C2097317 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0947630 C0085971 C1145359 C1444476 C1444479 C0376636 C0886296 C1948041 C1273869 C2979881 C2183254 C0021228 C2097317 C0392366 C0456984 C0085971 C1145359 C1444476 C1444479 C0376636 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0199176 C0425152 C2937292 C0013126 C1626409 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1578513 C2239238 C3244304 C0699943 C1553687 C0376649 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C1548385 C1301725 C1609436 C0729829 C0724128 C1569289 C1552601 C1720467 C1571886 C3273187 C0085971 C1145359 C1444476 C1444479 C0376636 C3864998 C0009647 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0012634 C1571886 C3273187 C1571886 C3273187 C0080194 C0180153 C0680830 C0556512 C0562337 C2363670 C1626409 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0740858 C0747752 C0013146 C0038577 C2322587 C0348089 C0020792 C3516629 C0150323 C0277767 C0557971 C2097317 C0243161 C1549439 C3835651 ", "concepts": "Case Management, Disease Management, High Risk, High Risk, American elm summary, summary case management, Case management, Food case management, Home case management, disease management, study, test, test engagement, engagement, drug abuse, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, care, elated, Unrelated health services, American elm description, prescription, prescription Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, study case management, Case management, Food case management, Home case management, disease management, intervention, Intervention, Intervention, Interventions, interventional individuality, American elm test, test case management, Case management, Food case management, Home case management, disease management, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, prevention, engagement, engagement, drive, Inservice interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, new public health, public health, Public health, public healthcare, addresses documents, Document, document, documents, documented, documented, urates urban, Curban assigned, Only, professional, professional case management, Case management, Food case management, Home case management, disease management, Condition, Conditioned, condition Condition, Conditioned, condition, professional, professional professional, professional, strained, covering management techniques, Room management technique, Anger management technique, developer Inservice criteria, Eligibility Criteria rndx substance abuse, multisubstance abuse, substance abuse drug, substance abuse test high-risk sexual behavior, High-risk sexual behavr Identification, Sex identification, Risk identification, Body identification, Goal identification, American elm Criteria Resident, Resident "}
