Tumor (GTT)\n          -  WHO score 2-6 (re-evaluated at the time of relapse\n          -  Histologically confirmed complete or partial moles on initial evacuation\n          -  Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency should avoid taking NSAIDs with\n             short elimination half-lives for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days\n             following administration of

administration.\n          -  Folic Acid (350-1000 micrograms) must be given daily beginning approximately 5-7 days\n             prior to first dose of pemetrexed and continuing daily until 3 weeks after the last\n             dose of study therapy.\n          -  Vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) will be administered as an intramuscular injection\n             approximately 1 to 2 weeks prior to first dose of pemetrexed and repeated\n             approximately every 9 weeks until 3 weeks after the last dose of study therapy.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Previous treatment that included chemotherapy other than actinomycin -D or\n             methotrexate (+/- folinic acid).\n          -  Patients with more than 8 metastatic lesions identified\n          -  Patients with
