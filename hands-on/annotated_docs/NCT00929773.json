{"text": "TITLE:\n      Low Level Laser Therapy to Reduce Chronic Pain\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study was to determine whether low level laser light directed at the\n      neck and shoulders could be effective in the temporary reduction of chronic pain in the neck\n      and shoulder region.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Chronic neck and shoulder pain arising from osteoarthritis, chronic muscle spasms or\n      thoracic or cervical spine sprain strain can be seriously debilitating. Currently available\n      treatment options such as pain relief medication, ice pack, massage, physical therapy and\n      chiropractic are typically of limited effectiveness. More permanent options such as surgery\n      are invasive with long recovery periods and side-effects and complications of their own. Low\n      level laser light therapy, with its proven anti-inflammatory ability, offers a simple\n      non-invasive option for the reduction of chronic neck and shoulder pain.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Muscular-skeletal pain in the neck/shoulder region\n          -  Acute and chronic pain in the neck/shoulder region\n          -  Restricted range of motion in the neck/shoulder region\n          -  Fibrosis or scar tissue in the neck/shoulder region\n          -  Inflammation in the neck/shoulder region\n          -  Altered function in the neck/shoulder region\n          -  Muscle strains in the neck/shoulder region\n          -  Rating of 30 or greater on the 0-100 Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scale\n          -  18-65 years of age\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Severely herniated disks\n          -  Pregnancy\n          -  Taken pain medication within the past 12 hours\n", "cuis": "C0279027 C0150055 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C1550472 C0275586 C4050469 C0007859 C0037004 C3245481 C0935456 C0441610 C0027530 C2137077 C0037004 C0524468 C0524469 C0869975 C1283792 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0746672 C0029408 C0029410 C0409929 C2893907 C0263746 C0263854 C0409959 C0455572 C0586735 C0037011 C0423670 C1547296 C1555457 C0027530 C2137077 C0728985 C1284110 C0412650 C0412718 C0423674 C4035684 C0038048 C0559440 C0817096 C0729233 C0683525 C0029709 C0949766 C0553651 C0204093 C1948126 C2064714 C2148126 C0451615 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C0181264 C0851189 C0024875 C3536731 C0344217 C0683525 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C3834249 C4049609 C4049610 C4050368 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0025344 C2004454 C0421316 C1334278 C0031765 C0041626 C0679653 C0700164 C0003209 C0723323 C0037011 C0423670 C0441610 C0027530 C2137077 C0683525 C1334278 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0007859 C0037004 C0524468 C0524469 C0869975 C1283792 C0007859 C0037004 C0524468 C0524469 C0869975 C1283792 C1547229 C1547295 C0080078 C0150220 C2607871 C0576002 C2055622 C0576094 C1319209 C1549594 C0037004 C0524468 C0524469 C0869975 C1283792 C0027530 C2137077 C0241158 C2004491 C0016059 C0037004 C0524468 C0524469 C0869975 C1283792 C0027530 C2137077 C0021368 C0014236 C0017574 C0029877 C0037004 C0524468 C0524469 C0869975 C1283792 C0027530 C2137077 C0031843 C1705273 C0037004 C0524468 C0524469 C0869975 C1283792 C0027530 C2137077 C0037004 C0524468 C0524469 C0869975 C1283792 C0080194 C1510453 C0027530 C2137077 C1995013 C3536884 C0175659 C0349674 C0237849 C0684254 C0030193 C0175456 C0243161 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0002771 C0849174 ", "concepts": "Low Level Laser Therapy, Chronic Pain summary, summary study, low, blight, Slight pain in neck, shoulders, temporary, tempora, reduction, neck, neck shoulders, R shoulder, L shoulder, Shoulder, Shoulder description, prescription, prescription chronic muscle spasms, osteoarthritis, hips osteoarthritis, Toe osteoarthritis, Polyosteoarthritis, hand osteoarthritis, neck osteoarthritis, knee osteoarthritis, H/O: osteoarthritis, Foot osteoarthritis, shoulder pains, shoulder pain, Chronic, Chronic, neck, neck cervical spines, Cervical spine, cervical spine ct, cervical spine MRI, cervical spine pain, Head cervical spine, sprain strain, Groin strain, thoracics, Thoracic treatment options, physical; therapy, physical therapies, Other physical therapy, other physical therapy, physical therapy care, chest physical therapy, physical therapy goals, pain relief, Medications, medication:, medications:, Premedication, IV medication, Medications, Medications, Ice pack, Ice pack, massage, massage chiropractic, options, surgery, surgery, surgery:, Unlimited, Unlimited, Unlimited, Unlimited Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, periods, recover, HRT side-effects, Invasive light therapy, UV light therapy, insight therapy, proven, Anti-inflammatory, simplet shoulder pains, shoulder pain, reduction, neck, neck, options, Invasive criteria, Eligibility Criteria pain in neck, shoulders, R shoulder, L shoulder, Shoulder, Shoulder pain in neck, shoulders, R shoulder, L shoulder, Shoulder, Shoulder, Acute, Acute Range of motion, rnox range of motion, Range of motion, Hip range of motion, TMJ range of motion, Knee range of motion, Neck range of motion, Restricted, shoulders, R shoulder, L shoulder, Shoulder, Shoulder, neck, neck scar tissues, Scar tissue, Fibrosis, shoulders, R shoulder, L shoulder, Shoulder, Shoulder, neck, neck Inflammation NOS, Inflammation;eye, Inflammation gum, Ear Inflammation, shoulders, R shoulder, L shoulder, Shoulder, Shoulder, neck, neck function, Function, shoulders, R shoulder, L shoulder, Shoulder, Shoulder, neck, neck shoulders, R shoulder, L shoulder, Shoulder, Shoulder, strain, strain, neck, neck, Muscles Visual Analog Scale, scales, scale, scales, scaler, pain, vas Criteria pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
