{"text": "TITLE:\n      Using Sodium Lactate Ringer's Injection Resuscitate Septic Shock Patients\nSUMMARY:\n      Using sodium lactate Ringer's injection resuscitate septic shock patients and Compared with\n      other solution, in order to make clear whether can improve the prognosis.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Experimental evidence repeatedly demonstrated that the shock patients can use substrates\n      other than glucose to sustain increased activity, including lactate.Increased lactate can be\n      the consequence of anaerobic metabolism, i.e., the formation of lactate in the presence of\n      low oxygen. However, emerging evidence demonstrated that in patients with sepsis increased\n      lactate seems predominantly non-hypoxic/ischemic and rather the consequence of increased\n      glycolysis. Utilization of lactate as an alternative fuel may be an adaptive response to\n      maximize energy function and limit substrate reduction.Uptake of exogenous lactate has\n      indeed been demonstrated after traumatic brain injury and acute heart failure in humans.\n      The investigators assume that administration of supplemental lactate significantly\n      contributes to energy metabolism in septic shock, which can have beneficial help for septic\n      shock resuscitation.\n      Inclusion criteria:diagnosis in patients with septic shock and age 18 years old or more.\n      Exclusion criteria: pregnant women and nursing mothers, severe liver failure with child\n      class C , use linezolid anti-infection treatment, pheochromocytoma patients, CVVH therapy\n      patients, malignant tumor patients, using epinephrine.\n      The investigators will use sodium lactate Ringer's injection resuscitate septic shock\n      patients and Compared with other solution, the organ function monitoring include heart,\n      kidney,and brain. Others study endpoints include 28-day mortality,hospitalized mortality.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  diagnosis in patients with septic shock\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  pregnant women and nursing mothers\n          -  severe liver failure with child class C\n          -  using Linezolid\n          -  pheochromocytoma\n          -  hematologic
