{"text": "TITLE:\n      Dental Support Device During Breastfeeding as a Mean for Pain Control\nSUMMARY:\n      Leboride is a dental support device that was developed for reducing pain during active\n      labor. It is made of an inert material, placed in the woman's mouth and does not disturb\n      breathing, talking, or any other activity expected during labor. It is a single-use device,\n      each user receives a new one.\n      This study hypothesis is that the Leboride use can reduce pain during breastfeeding, by that\n      improve women's breastfeeding experience, and increase breastfeeding rates.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Dental support device is effective in increasing isometric force in different muscle\n      contraction [1-7].

In this stage the woman has\n      to contract muscles in order to push the fetus through the birth canal.\n      Leboride is a dental support device that was developed for reducing pain during active\n      labor. It is made of an inert material, placed in the woman's mouth and does not disturb\n      breathing, talking, or any other activity expected during labor. It is a single-use device,\n      each user receives a new one.\n      This study hypothesis is that the Leboride use can reduce pain during breastfeeding, by that\n      improve women's breastfeeding experience, and increase breastfeeding rates.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          1.
