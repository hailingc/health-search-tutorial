{"text": "TITLE:\n      Immediate Mobilization After Cardiac Catheterisation\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate the frequency of bleeding and haematomas in\n      patients undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention via femoral\n      artery and mobilized immediately after the procedure, compared to those mobilized after two\n      hours (following the standard regimen). At the same time the investigators will investigate\n      whether it reduces the discomfort being mobilized immediately after the procedure.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The frequency of hematoma, bleeding or pseudoaneurysm at the access site in the groin is\n      7-15% with regimens that involve 0-2 hours of bed rest, somewhat more frequent after\n      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) than coronary angiography (CAG). There seems to be\n      no reduction in the complications of the CAG or PCI by maintaining the bed rest for more\n      than 2 hours after the procedure. Angio-Seal seems most effective of current closure\n      devices. There is less discomfort associated with early compared with late mobilization.\n      Protamine reverse heparin's effect without the side effects of that regime.\n      There lacks a larger randomized study of the safety of mobilizing patients immediately after\n      CAG and after PCI.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  CAG or PCI performed via the femoral artery\n          -  No hematoma in the groin (> 5 cm in diameter)\n          -  Heparin reversed with protamine after PCI\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Oozing, bleeding or hematoma\n          -  Treatment with Integrilin, ReoPro, or Marevan\n          -  Heparin can not be reversed\n          -  The patient does not want to participate\n          -  Systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg after the procedure\n          -  BMI> 35 (can be modified if the groin can be assessed in an upright position)\n          -  Demented, unconscious patients who do not understand the information for\n             participants.\n", "cuis": "C0007430 C0770826 C0185112 C2080791 C0018787 C0007144 C0153417 C1262603 C1697779 C1552616 C1706244 C0018944 C0019080 C0947630 C2347273 C3898838 C0085532 C1633729 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0018787 C0015811 C0185112 C0578718 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0003842 C1697779 C0040808 C2945654 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C2364135 C0234215 C0185112 C0578718 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C1697779 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0162868 C1510412 C0018944 C1962958 C0019080 C0018246 C2347273 C3898838 C2945654 C0040808 C0004910 C2984079 C1532338 C4049682 C4049683 C4034923 C4049680 C4049681 C1532297 C1320647 C4037588 C0085532 C1633729 C1328018 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0441610 C0004910 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C4071827 C0185112 C2080791 C0020944 C4048292 C0185113 C2364135 C0234215 C1328018 C0033603 C0019134 C0770546 C0879626 C0040808 C2945654 C0185112 C0947630 C1697779 C1328018 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0015801 C1280173 C0226448 C1281581 C0226455 C0018944 C1962958 C0018246 C0033603 C0019134 C0770546 C0243161 C0019080 C0018944 C1962958 C1446325 C0950902 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0699129 C0592046 C0019134 C0770546 C0488055 C0871470 C1306620 C0428883 C0488052 C1305849 C4071677 C0277884 C0488231 C1319895 C0488229 C4050449 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0018246 C0231519 C0240795 C0556030 C0681324 C2347268 C0041654 C0041657 C0234421 C0162340 C0860630 C0011343 C3242430 C1561528 ", "concepts": "Catheterisation, Catheterisation kit, mobilizations, mobilization, Cardiac, Cardia, Cardia, Cardiacap, immediate summary, summary haematomas, bleeding, study, Frequency, Frequency coronary angiogram, Coronary angiogram, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, coronary, femoral mobilize, mobilize, Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure, artery, immediate regimen, regimen, standards, Standard, Standard discomforts, Discomfort, mobilize, mobilize, Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure, immediate description, prescription, prescription pseudoaneurysms, Pseudoaneurysms, hematomas, Hematoma, bleeding, groin, Frequency, Frequency regimens, regimen, bed rest, Somewhat Percutaneous coronary intervention (procedure), Percutaneous coronary intervention panel, Percutaneous coronary intervention panel, Percutaneous coronary intervention report, Percutaneous coronary intervention device panel, Percutaneous coronary intervention device panel, Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention, History of percutaneous coronary intervention, Percutaneous coronary intervention Study report, coronary angiogram, Coronary angiogram, Therex Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, reduction, bed rest Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure, Angio mobilizations, mobilization, immobilization, Immobilization, Remobilization, discomforts, Discomfort, Therex Protamine, heparins, heparin, side effect, regimen, regimen mobilizing, study, immediate, Therex criteria, Eligibility Criteria femoral arteries, Femoral artery, Left femoral artery, Left femoral artery, Deep femoral artery hematomas, Hematoma, groin protamine, Heparin, Heparin Criteria bleeding, hematomas, Hematoma, Oozing Integrilin, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Marevan, ReoPro Heparin, Heparin Systolic blood pressure, Systolic blood pressure, NOS, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, Diastolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, Aorta Systolic blood pressure, high systolic blood pressure, Systolic blood pressure--supine, Lying systolic blood pressure, Systolic blood pressure--sitting, Invasive Systolic blood pressure, Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure groin, opposition, positional, Reposition, exposition, Position Unconscious, Unconscious, conscious, understand, demented, cemented, informational, Information "}
