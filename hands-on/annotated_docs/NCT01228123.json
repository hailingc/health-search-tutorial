{"text": "TITLE:\n      Clinical Trial Comparing Continuous Versus Intermittent Hemodialysis in ICU Patients\nSUMMARY:\n      The mortality of acute renal failure (ARF) remains to be high (around 60-70%) despite\n      manifold improvements in ICU care. At present, it is not clear if the method chosen for\n      renal replacement therapy, i.e. intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) or continuous\n      haemofiltration (CVVH), might impact on the outcome of these patients. For this purpose, a\n      prospective randomised clinical study of the effect of continuous versus intermittent renal\n      replacement therapy on the mortality and outcome of acute renal failure will be performed.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      please see above\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  all ICU patients requiring renal replacement therapy\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  patient denies informed consent\n          -  patient not requiring intensive care therapy\n          -  kidney transplanted patients\n          -  chronic renal failure (serum creatinine > 3mg/dl)\n", "cuis": "C1096775 C0019004 C0577541 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1968660 C1552616 C1706244 C0022660 C3854173 C0477745 C0264490 C0181722 C0025663 C0025664 C0580931 C0206074 C0279033 C0019004 C0151744 C0745348 C1444662 C0019014 C0947630 C0022646 C0745348 C1444662 C3272565 C0279033 C1304648 C0206074 C0598391 C0022660 C3854173 C0477745 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0206074 C0279033 C0243161 C0009797 C0085559 C0087111 C0033972 C0022671 C0677491 C1261317 C0022661 C2316810 C0301609 C0403462 C0477746 C0271932 C0201976 C0600061 C0858112 C0428282 ", "concepts": "Clinical Trial, Hemodialysis, Hemodialysis NEC, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, (2) Intermittent summary, summary arf, Acute renal failure, Other acute renal failure, arf manifold, method, methods, care renal replacement therapy, replacement therapy, haemodialysis, ihd, intermittency, Discontinuous haemofiltration study, renal, intermittency, Discontinuous, Clinical replacement therapy, Gene replacement therapy, renal replacement therapy, enzyme replacement therapy, acute renal failures, Acute renal failure, Other acute renal failure description, prescription, prescription criteria, Eligibility Criteria renal replacement therapy, replacement therapy Criteria informed consent form intensive care, therapy, Cotherapy kidney transplanted, [V]Kidney transplanted, transplanted kidney Chronic renal failure NOS, Chronic renal failure, diet chronic renal failure, acute chronic renal failure, Other chronic renal failure, anemia chronic renal failure, serum creatinine test, serum creatinine level, serum creatine, low serum creatinine "}
