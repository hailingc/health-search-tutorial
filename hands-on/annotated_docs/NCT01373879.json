{"text": "TITLE:\n      AdCh63 ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP Malaria Vaccines Evaluation in Healthy Adults and Children in a Malaria Endemic Area\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of MVA ME-TRAP and\n      AdCH63 ME-TRAP candidate vaccines in healthy children and adult volunteers in a malaria\n      endemic region. The regimen proposed here has protected non-immune volunteers in Oxford\n      against sporozoite challenge, and so may be protective against naturally acquired infection\n      in The Gambia.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Consenting adult males aged 18-50 years in good health and healthy children aged 2-6\n             years.with consenting parents.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Clinically significant history of skin disorder (psoriasis, contact dermatitis etc.),\n             allergy, symptomatic immunodeficiency, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease,\n             endocrine disorder, liver disease, renal disease, gastrointestinal disease,\n             neurological illness.\n          -  Severe malnutrition.\n          -  Hypersensitivity to HDCRV.\n          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of\n             the vaccines, e.g. egg products, Kathon, neomycin, betapropiolactone.\n          -  History of splenectomy Haemoglobin less than 9.0 g/dL, where judged to be clinically\n             significant in the opinion of the investigator\n          -  Serum Creatinine concentration greater than 70 mol/L, where judged to be clinically\n             significant in the opinion of the investigator\n          -  Serum ALT concentration greater than 45 U/L, where judged to be clinically\n             significant in the opinion of the investigator\n          -  Blood transfusion within one month of enrolment.\n          -  History of vaccination with previous experimental malaria vaccines.\n          -  Administration of any other vaccine or immunoglobulin within two weeks before\n             vaccination.\n          -  Current participation in another clinical trial, or within 12 weeks of this study.\n          -  Any other finding which in the opinion of the investigators would increase the risk\n             of an adverse outcome from participation in the trial.\n          -  Likelihood of travel away from the study area.\n          -  HIV positive.\n          -  Positive malaria antigen test\n", "cuis": "C0206255 C0220825 C1261322 C0024530 C3541306 C0184047 C1552616 C1706244 C0184047 C0018792 C0042210 C0024530 C0206255 C1744563 C0184047 C0686744 C0040808 C2945654 C0805586 C2347900 C2348080 C0798503 C0009450 C3714514 C0275524 C0012683 C0035637 C0276041 C0729555 C0747002 C3245488 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0686744 C0090785 C0243161 C0011616 C0406261 C0406271 C0162824 C0452157 C0263238 C0406272 C0037274 C0033860 C1815389 C0262926 C2004062 C3272565 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0558373 C0849932 C0264656 C0042373 C0035204 C0035242 C0455540 C0264219 C0264221 C1290325 C0455409 C0021051 C1855166 C0043194 C0221026 C0549463 C1279481 C3714976 C0020517 C0489531 C1527304 C0719113 C0719656 C3247823 C0231221 C0017178 C0455553 C0455420 C0021831 C0857590 C0014130 C0455484 C0553665 C1285294 C0023895 C2186532 C3280432 C0455417 C0022658 C0001621 C1857414 C2186518 C0311276 C0267981 C0020517 C0520946 C0559469 C0577620 C0013182 C0016470 C0079840 C3489856 C0441750 C0577628 C0949570 C0436331 C0262926 C2004062 C0012634 C0018609 C0000828 C0442740 C1524073 C0042210 C0027603 C0027515 C0701906 C1508746 C0581077 C0518015 C0200695 C1275423 C1168037 C0948093 C0474543 C1561562 C2239101 C0871010 C0201976 C2981751 C4055609 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C0871010 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C0229671 C1546774 C1550100 C0871010 C0005841 C0179335 C0430274 C2741651 C0744963 C1561542 C1960631 C0206255 C1533734 C0725057 C0376495 C3845829 C0001563 C0036589 C0455708 C1534841 C2360550 C0021027 C0020843 C0020852 C0202081 C0481219 C0085297 C0553533 C2748351 C0202083 C2825347 C0577612 C0202086 C0202087 C3536873 C0202084 C0201467 C0850992 C0042210 C0042196 C2713304 C0058773 C0419749 C1096775 C0947630 C0871010 C3687374 C0018792 C1555670 C0947630 C0019699 C3686758 C0729856 C0430424 C0201385 C2367449 C1514241 C0024530 C0206255 C1744563 ", "concepts": "Malaria Vaccines, evaluation, evaluation, Malaria, Malaria, trap summary, summary trap, Atrial vaccines, malarias, malaria, malari, trap, healthy child regimen, regimen challenges, Rechallenge, Dechallenge, Challenge, Infection, infections, Coinfections, Disinfection, RP infection, MG infection, GI infection, op infection, acquired criteria, Eligibility Criteria healthy child, 18-502 Criteria Contact dermatitis NOS, Oil contact dermatitis, Egg contact dermatitis, photocontact dermatitis, Photocontact dermatitis, Acute contact dermatitis, plant contact dermatitis, skin disorder, psoriasis, psoriasin, history, history, Clinical CVD -
