{"text": "TITLE:\n      Incidence, Severity and Treatment of Delirium in Cardiac Surgery Patients: A Before-after Study\nSUMMARY:\n      Delirium is a common yet under diagnosed condition in hospitalized patients, and the\n      incidence have not previously been described in Danish cardiac surgery patients. The present\n      study seeks to describe the incidence and duration of delirium in this group of patients,\n      before and after the introduction of standardized screening tool and a guideline for\n      treatment of delirium after cardiac surgery.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Delirium is a common yet under diagnosed condition in cardiac surgery patients, and may\n      cause prolonged cognitive impairment and increased risk of complications. Patients are at\n      risk of e.g. pulling catheters and lines and may fall attempting to get out of bed. The\n      aging patient population present with many risk factors for developing delirium, but\n      diagnostic tools have been few. Almost 50% present with hypoactive delirium, which is often\n      not diagnosed, nor treated correctly. To optimize effect, treatment should be initiated\n      early, maintained until clinical improvement is observed, and then tapered gradually.\n      Recently, Delirium Observation Screening scale (DOS scale) was developed and validated in\n      elective cardiac surgery patients in the Netherlands, with interesting results. This\n      encouraged us to evaluate the effects of systematic delirium screening and treatment in\n      cardiac surgery patients. To our knowledge, no prior studies have evaluated use of DOS scale\n      in this context.\n      OBJECTIVES To evaluate the incidence and severity of delirium, and the effects of\n      standardized treatment in a population of Danish cardiac surgery patients.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  adult patients admitted for cardiac surgery at department of cardiothoracic surgery,\n             Rigshospitalet, denmark\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  patients under age 18,\n          -  patients that died within 24 hours after admission.\n", "cuis": "C0018821 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C2983285 C0011206 C1705850 C0947630 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0701159 C0011900 C1408353 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0011206 C3245511 C0018787 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0011206 C0947630 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C1552839 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0282423 C0162791 C0220845 C0376495 C1293116 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0011206 C0018787 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0011900 C1408353 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0011206 C0018787 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C3245511 C0338656 C1270972 C3554639 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0151872 C0151878 C0151576 C0151680 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C0085590 C1704454 C0179768 C0745442 C1322976 C0580846 C0085639 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0011206 C0001811 C0034634 C0577277 C0011206 C0011900 C0358514 C0430022 C1547424 C0086439 C0015733 C0183622 C0489144 C0011900 C1408353 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0332155 C0441640 C3844714 C3272565 C0557985 C0700325 C1964257 C0478530 C0220908 C1710031 C0199230 C1409616 C1698960 C0011206 C0175659 C0349674 C0237849 C0684254 C2363670 C0543488 C0018787 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C1546398 C1546846 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0011206 C0220825 C0376554 C4036285 C0018787 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0947630 C0175659 C0349674 C0237849 C0684254 C0220825 C0449255 C0018017 C2239270 C0011206 C0220825 C2983285 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0018787 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C2242990 C0524832 C0184666 C0809949 C0018787 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0243161 C0184666 C0809949 C0011065 ", "concepts": "Cardiac Surgery, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Severity, Delirium, Before, Study, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary hospitalized, diagnosed, Undiagnosed, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, Delirium, common cardiac, surgery, surgery, surgery: delirium, study, Induration, Duration, Duration, groups screening, Screening, screening, screening, Screening, Guideline, Guideline, guidelines, Reintroduction, Introduction Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, delirium, cardiac, surgery, surgery, surgery: description, prescription, prescription diagnosed, Undiagnosed, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, Delirium, cardiac, surgery, surgery, surgery:, common cognitive impairment, Mild cognitive impairment, Severe cognitive impairment, Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, PT increased, QT increased, CK increased, LH increased, pH increased, GH increased, increased mg, CI increased, Na increased, K+ increased, Zn increased, T4 increased, T3 increased catheter, catheter, catheters iv, catheters iv, catheters cv, pulling, fall risk factors, risk factors, No risk factors, A/N risk factors, delirium, aging, raging, Ovulation present delirium, Diagnostic, Diagnostic, Diagnostic, Diagnostic, Hypoactive, stools, Stools, Stools diagnosed, Undiagnosed, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, untreated tapered, No improvement, Clinical Observation, observation, Observational, observation, screening, screening, screening, screening, screening, Delirium, scales, scale, scales, scaler, developer interesting, cardiac, surgery, surgery, surgery:, Elective, Elective screening, Screening, screening, screening, Screening, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, delirium, Evaluate knowledge, No knowledge, cardiac, surgery, surgery, surgery:, studies, scales, scale, scales, scaler, Evaluated context objective, objective, delirium, Evaluate, Severity Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, cardiac, surgery, surgery, surgery: criteria, Eligibility Criteria cardiothoracic surgery, thoracic surgery, admitted, Admitted, cardiac, surgery, surgery, surgery: Criteria admissions, Admission, died "}
