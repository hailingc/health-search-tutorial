HR in\n      ECG holter monitoring, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), symptoms, rescue medication\n      consumption and AEs were evaluated in both periods of treatment.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  documented diagnosis of asthma or COPD in accordance with guidelines\n          -  stable condition, defined as a disease without exacerbation for at least 1 month\n             prior to study enrolment\n          -  mean HR in holter ECG recording of \u2265 60 bpm\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  disease exacerbation in previous month\n          -  inability to understand instructions on study procedures\n", "cuis": "C1546767 C0042497 C0035208 C0087153 C2266627 C0257190 C0012634 C0458827 C0178987 C1820370 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0018810 C2041121 C2197023 C0488794 C3845990 C0947630 C0042497 C0087153 C2266627 C1546767 C1820370 C0257190 C0004096 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0004096 C0032042 C0456909 C0947630 C0180112 C2911690 C0257190 C0032042 C0030735 C1542834 C1518922 C0812830 C0429740 C0429741 C0520841 C0729284 C0013801 C0182920 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C1457887 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0025344 C1947907 C4071751 C0220825 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1301725 C1609436 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C0162791 C0220845 C0282423 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0004096 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0018609 C1561542 C0947630 C0243161 C0012634 C0018609 C1561542 C0302828 C0441513 C3263700 C0162340 C0025664 C0184661 C0947630 ", "concepts": "Respiratory, Respirators, Respirators, respirator, respirator, Ivabradine, Disease, Airways, Airways, flowering, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary Heart rate, heart rate, heart rate, Heart rate, No heart rate, study, respirators, respirator, respirator, Respiratory, flowering ivabradine, asthma description, prescription, prescription asthmatics, placebo, blind, study, controllers, Controlled ivabradine, placebo pefr, PEFR - Peak expiratory flow rate, peak expiratory flow, Peak expiratory flow rate (p, Single peak expiratory flow rate, Serial peak expiratory flow rate, Normal peak expiratory flow rate, Expected peak expiratory flow rate, holter monitor, holter monitor, Medications, medication:, medications:, Premedication, IV medication, Medications, Medications, symptoms Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, periods, Consumption, O2 consumption, Evaluated criteria, Eligibility Criteria Documented, Documented, document, document, document, Guidelines, guidelines, guideline, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, asthma disease, Condition, conditioning, precondition, h disease, month study Criteria disease, h disease, month instructions, Construction, Instructions, understand, procedures, Procedures, study "}
