{"text": "TITLE:\n      Safety of Treatment of Uterine Fibroids With Asoprisnil\nSUMMARY:\n      The objective of this study is to determine the long-term safety of asoprisnil in women with\n      symptomatic uterine fibroids who completed the 6 month Study C02-037.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      No medical therapy is currently available for the long-term treatment of abnormal uterine\n      bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in women and many women must resort to surgery for\n      relief. The objective of this study is to determine the long-term safety of asoprisnil 10\n      and 25 mg administered daily for 18 months to subjects with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata\n      who completed the 6 month Study C02-037. The safety endpoints for this study will be based\n      on assessments of the endometrium, ovarian cysts, lipid profiles, adverse events and\n      clinical laboratory evaluations.\n      Some subjects receiving asoprisnil developed endometrial changes. As a result, dosing was\n      prematurely discontinued for all subjects. To ensure safety, subjects will remain on study\n      and will undergo scheduled study procedures. In most subjects, endometrial changes reversed\n      after asoprisnil discontinuation.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Women that have completed 6 months of treatment in study C02-037 with no more than a\n             7-day interruption in their treatment\n          -  Otherwise good health\n          -  Premenopausal based on Estrogen and Follicle Stimulating Hormone levels\n          -  Agrees to double-barrier method of contraception\n          -  Adequate endometrial biopsy with no significant histological disorder\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Any abnormal lab or procedure result(s) the study-doctor considers important\n          -  History of a blood-clotting disorder\n          -  Any prior surgical and/or invasive procedure(s) for uterine fibroids that resulted in\n             either a cure or made the symptoms go away\n          -  Significant gynecological disorder, such as endometrial polyp\n", "cuis": "C0042133 C1455381 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C1552616 C1706244 C1455381 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0947630 C0042133 C1561542 C0947630 C0231221 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0023977 C0418981 C2069680 C0042149 C0042133 C0019080 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C1455381 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0564405 C1949411 C2954408 C0947630 C0042133 C0231221 C1561542 C1561542 C0947630 C0877248 C1963761 C0029927 C0030584 C1261322 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C0014180 C0007103 C0346191 C1269566 C1546618 C1550633 C0476089 C0523744 C0220825 C1261322 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C3272565 C1455381 C0014180 C0476089 C2363670 C0947630 C1444662 C1706472 C0025664 C0184661 C0947630 C0014180 C0476089 C0086960 C0457454 C1444662 C1455381 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0947630 C1561542 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C2266640 C0202022 C0733758 C0016774 C1154272 C2344409 C3163495 C3860151 C0342386 C1154273 C2344407 C0014939 C0202006 C2936882 C3541386 C0528521 C0720298 C1330258 C1096235 C0206158 C0025320 C0004764 C0558250 C0700589 C0344221 C0493327 C0877698 C0086286 C0086580 C3641827 C0404066 C1510477 C3879967 C0012634 C0243161 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0947630 C0013418 C0473462 C0005779 C0262926 C2004062 C0005768 C0229664 C0042133 C4048276 C0814177 C0543467 C0587668 C1457887 C0017411 C0475165 C0156369 C1704273 C1168249 ", "concepts": "Uterine Fibroids, Asoprisnil, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment summary, summary asoprisnil, Objective, objective, Objective, study uterine fibroids, month, Study, Asymptomatic description, prescription, prescription long-term treatment, Medical therapy, medical therapy, uterine uterine fibroids, bleeding, surgery, surgery, surgery: asoprisnil, Objective, objective, Objective, relief, Prelief, Urelief, study uterine leiomyomata, Asymptomatic, month month, study adverse events, No adverse event, ovarian cysts, parovarian cysts, assessment, Assessment, Assessment, Assessment, Endometrium, Endometrium, Endometrium, Endometrium, Endometrium, Endometrium, Ca endometrium, lipids Evaluation, Evaluation, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory, Clinical asoprisnil, endometria, endometrial ca, developer study, Discontinue, Discontinue procedures, Procedures, study, endometria, endometrial ca, schedule discontinuations, Discontinuation, asoprisnil criteria, Eligibility Criteria Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, study, month Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, interruption IVC Follicle Stimulating Hormone, FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone), Follicle Stimulating Hormone, Human, Follicle Stimulating Hormone 75 UNT/ML, Follicle Stimulating Hormone 50 UNT/ML, Follicle Stimulating Hormone 35 UNT/ML, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (Porcine), Follicle Stimulating Hormone Deficiency, Follicle Stimulating Hormone 150 UNT/ML, Follicle Stimulating Hormone 100 UNT/ML, Estrogens, Estrogens, Estrogen, Estrogens, strogen, Estrogenic, Estrogel, premenopausal, Premenopause, menopausal barrier method, Male barrier method, contraception, IUD contraception, CAP contraception, CAP contraception, Contraception;F, Contraception;M, Agree endometrial biopsy, endometrial biopsy, Endometrial biopsy kit, disorder Criteria Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure, study, abnormal labor, abnormal labor clotting disorder, History, History, blood, blood uterine fibroids, invasive procedure, Noninvasive procedure, Surgical, Surgical symptoms gynecological disorder, H/O gynecological disorder, endometrial polyps, endometrial polyps, Myometrial polyp "}
