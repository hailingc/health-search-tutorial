{"text": "TITLE:\n      The Effects of Inorganic Nitrate on Cardiac Muscle in Angina\nSUMMARY:\n      Previous studies have shown that interventions which modestly increase blood nitrite_\n      improve skeletal muscle function on exercise while sparing oxygen, and have been also shown\n      to open up the blood flow during periods of oxygen deprivation. Inorganic nitrate in the\n      diet is absorbed into the bloodstream, concentrated and reduced by bacteria in the mouth to\n      nitrite, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. .\n      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of oral inorganic nitrate\n      supplementation on clinical markers of heart ischaemia and the frequency of angina.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients aged 18 and over with chronic stable angina (\u22652 months duration).\n        Inclusion Criteria Following screening visit:\n          -  A positive exercise ECG (1mmSTD at J+0.08 seconds) on a modified Bruce protocol\n             treadmill exercise test.\n          -  A positive dobutamine stress echocardiogram,\n          -  and/or a positive myocardial perfusion scan (MPI),\n          -  and/or a positive coronary angiogram.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Unable to do exercise test\n          -  Women of child bearing potential\n          -  If of a racial origin at risk of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency,\n             G6PD will be excluded prior to inclusion in the study\n          -  Resting STD>=1mm\n          -  NYHA 3 or 4 HF or LVEF<45%\n          -  Myocardial infarction or revascularisation within the last two months\n          -  Left bundle branch block (LBBB)\n", "cuis": "C0018787 C0007144 C0153417 C1262603 C0002962 C2926611 C1995013 C1552616 C1706244 C0886296 C1948041 C1273869 C2979881 C2183254 C0947630 C0005768 C0229664 C0517929 C0030054 C0184633 C0452240 C1522704 C2242890 C0232338 C0455822 C0455848 C0025344 C0030054 C0184633 C3654024 C0012159 C1549512 C0005775 C0004618 C0004632 C0263216 C0005775 C0947630 C2945677 C3654024 C0242297 C0556088 C2935799 C2350507 C3537005 C0022116 C0002962 C2024883 C0018787 C0005516 C2347273 C3898838 C3272565 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0340288 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C1561542 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0243161 C1512346 C0442713 C0452240 C1522704 C1514241 C0015260 C2107089 C0920208 C0012963 C1514241 C0430471 C0841688 C1514241 C0085532 C1633729 C1514241 C0243161 C0015260 C1299582 C2222792 C1550512 C0391941 C0427508 C1167968 C3853619 C2939465 C1167969 C0020621 C0032827 C0162429 C0034341 C0268125 C1971019 C3150275 C3151082 C0947630 C1552867 C3843801 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0455406 C0155626 C0428953 C0948369 C3810814 C3845502 C0581603 C0581712 C0027686 C0472662 C0027056 C1561542 C0023211 C0344420 C0085615 C0006384 C0344421 C0225917 C0459156 C0155703 C0155702 ", "concepts": "Cardiac, Cardia, Cardia, Cardiacap, Angina, Angina, Muscles summary, summary intervention, Intervention, Intervention, Interventions, interventional, studies, blood, blood muscle function, oxygen, oxygen, exercises, Exercise deprivation, blood flow, LV blood flow, RV blood flow, periods, oxygen, oxygen, Organic nitrates diet, diet, Bloodstream, Bacteria, bacterin, bacterid Bloodstream study, effects oral, Organic nitrates supplementation, Fat supplementation, DTS supplementation, Viscosupplementation, Iron supplementation, ischaemia, anginas, angina, heart, marker, Frequency, Frequency, Clinical criteria, Eligibility Criteria chronic stable angina, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Induration, Duration, Duration, month screening, Screening, screening, screening, Screening, Criteria, visit Bruce protocol, exercises, Exercise, Positive exercise test, treadmill stress echocardiogram, dobutamine, Positive myocardial perfusion scanning, myocardial perfusion study, Positive coronary angiography, Coronary angiogram, Positive Criteria exercise test, Unable OT potential origin, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase test, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase normal, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficienc, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase abnormal, k deficiency, k deficiency, Deficiency, PC deficiency, NP deficiency, Na deficiency, C2 deficiency, C8 deficiency study, exclude 3 or 4 Myocardial infarction, NOS, Myocardial infarction, Old myocardial infarction, FH: Myocardial infarction, Myocardial infarction acute, ECG: myocardial infarction, Myocardial reinfarction, Myocardial Infarction, Myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularisation, Devascularisation, neovascularisation, Limb revascularisation, Heart revascularisation, month lbbb, ECG: left bundle branch block, right branch bundle block, branch bundle block, Right bundle branch block, Left bundle branch, Left bundle branch, Other left bundle branch block, Left bundle branch hemiblock "}
