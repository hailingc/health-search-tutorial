{"text": "TITLE:\n      Non-sedation Versus Sedation With a Daily Wake-up Trial in Critically Ill Patients Receiving Me-chanical Ventilation - Effects on Cognitive Function\nSUMMARY:\n      Through many years, the standard care has been to use continuous sedation of critically ill\n      patients during mechanical ventilation. However, preliminary randomised clinical trials\n      indicate that it is beneficial to reduce the sedation level in these patients. The NONSEDA\n      trial is an investigator-initiated, randomised, clinical, parallel-group, multinational,\n      superiority trial designed to include 700 patients from at least six ICUs in Denmark, Norway\n      and Sweden, comparing no sedation with sedation and a daily wake-up trial during mechanical\n      ventilation. This is a substudy of the NONSEDA trial, concerning 250 patients included at\n      trialsite Kolding, Denmark. The aim of the substudy is to assess the effects of no sedation\n      on delirium during admission and cognitive function after discharge from ICU.\n      Our hypothesis is that critically ill patients who are not sedated during mechanical\n      ventilation will have better cognitive function after discharge.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Endotracheally intubated\n          -  Expected time on ventilator > 24 hours\n          -  Age \u2265 18 years\n          -  Informed consent\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Severe head trauma where therapeutic coma is indicated\n          -  Therapeutic hypothermia where therapeutic coma is indicated\n          -  Status epilepticus where therapeutic coma is indicated\n          -  Patient has participated in the study before\n          -  Patient is transferred from another ICU with length of stay > 48 hours\n          -  Patient is comatose at admission\n          -  PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 9, if sedation is necessary for oxygenation\n          -  Patient does not speak Danish, swedish or norwegian at a reasonable level\n", "cuis": "C0009240 C4050130 C0392334 C3641649 C0010340 C2945579 C0035203 C0235195 C0344106 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0699886 C1966209 C1552616 C1706244 C0010340 C0235195 C0344106 C0580931 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C1444662 C0199470 C2223989 C3836859 C0042497 C2223988 C2228926 C2223979 C1096775 C1716046 C0235195 C0344106 C0018792 C1552839 C3272565 C0018792 C0235195 C0344106 C0442696 C0699886 C0018792 C0035203 C2945579 C0018792 C0235195 C0344106 C0392335 C2237115 C0392334 C2237374 C0184666 C0809949 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C0011206 C0010340 C0235195 C0699886 C0392335 C2237115 C0392334 C2237374 C0035203 C2945579 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0087153 C1611144 C2603364 C1517001 C1114365 C0243161 C0018674 C1547227 C1547231 C1561581 C4050465 C4050466 C0264097 C0009421 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C1444656 C0020674 C3260958 C0009421 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C1444656 C0038220 C0009421 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C1444656 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0947630 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0184666 C0809949 C0009421 C1547297 C2707410 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0235195 C0344106 C0412792 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0600116 ", "concepts": "Cognitive Functions, Cognitive Function, Cognitive Functioning, FACT-Cognitive Function, Critically Ill, Ventilation, ventilation, sedation, sedation, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Mechanical, Triall summary, summary critically ill, Sedation, Sedation, care, standards, Standard, Standard, Discontinuous Mechanical ventilation, NOS, mechanical ventilation rate, mechanical ventilation care, mechanical ventilators, mechanical ventilation volume, mechanical ventilation weaning, mode of mechanical ventilation, clinical trials, Dx preliminary Sedation, Sedation Atrial, groups, Clinical Atrial Sedation, Sedation, wake, Mechanical, Atrial ventilation, Ventilation, Atrial Sedation, Sedation Cognitive functioning, cognitive functions, cognitive functioning, no cognitive function, admissions, Admission, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, delirium critically ill, sedated, Mechanical Cognitive functioning, cognitive functions, cognitive functioning, no cognitive function, ventilation, Ventilation, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge criteria, Eligibility Criteria ventilators, Ventilators, on ventilator, Expected Age Criteria head trauma, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Sever, coma, Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic, Indicated Therapeutic hypothermia, EMS therapeutic hypothermia, coma, Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic, Indicated Status epilepticus, coma, Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic, Indicated Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, study Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient admissions, Admission, comatose, Comatose, Comatose, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient Sedation, Sedation, Preoxygenation Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, speak "}
