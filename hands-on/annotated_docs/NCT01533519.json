{"text": "TITLE:\n      A Dose Escalation Study of Intranasal Neuropeptide Y in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\nSUMMARY:\n      This study is designed to investigate the safety of intranasal administration of NPY using a\n      dose escalation, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover design in a\n      medication-free, symptomatic PTSD group.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Men and women, age 18-60.\n          -  Participants must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all tests and\n             examinations required by the protocol and must sign a written informed consent\n             document. We determine whether they have a sufficient understanding of the study\n             procedures and risks by asking them to explain what's involved in the study and to\n             give examples of study risks and benefits.\n          -  Participants must fulfill DSM-IV criteria for current PTSD, based on the Structured\n             Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) and on the\n             Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS).\n          -  CAPS score must be at least 40 (moderate PTSD severity) at screening.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Current, primary Axis I disorders other than PTSD.\n          -  History or current bipolar disorder or primary psychotic disorders (e.g.\n             schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder).\n          -  Current diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.\n          -  Women who are pregnant or are breast-feeding.\n          -  Drug or alcohol abuse or dependence within the preceding 3 months.\n          -  poorly controlled hypertension (manifest by SBP > 140 and/or DBP > 90); HR < 60 or >\n             100 at rest at the time of screening and confirmed immediately prior to randomization\n          -  Evidence of coronary artery disease as evidenced by history, abnormal ECG, typical\n             symptoms\n          -  History of arrhythmia, cardiac surgery, or family history of sudden death\n          -  Hepatic dysfunction as defined by AST and ALT > 2x URL, or alkaline phosphatase and\n             bilirubin > 1.5 x URL within X days prior to randomization\n          -  Chronic renal disease as defined by serum creatinine > 1.9\n          -  Any other serious or unstable clinically significant abnormal findings of laboratory\n             parameters, physical examination, or ECG as determined by the PI.\n          -  Any other serious or unstable condition that would put the subjects at undue risk as\n             determined by the PI or additional safety monitor.\n          -  Serious and imminent suicidal or homicidal risk.\n          -  Psychotropic medication that will not be tapered off at least 7 days prior to\n             screening; withdrawal symptoms must be absent at the time of screening\n          -  History of nasal disorders or sinonasal surgery, or significant nasal abnormalities\n             based on nasal exam.\n          -  Received investigational intervention within 30 days prior to randomization\n", "cuis": "C0038441 C0038436 C2698457 C0947630 C1552616 C1706244 C0001560 C0947630 C0032042 C0180112 C2911690 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C0231221 C1552839 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0162340 C0392366 C3850116 C0031809 C0582103 C3245501 C3245502 C1619636 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0009797 C0162340 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C1548385 C1301725 C1609436 C0947630 C0025664 C0184661 C0947630 C0947630 C0243161 C0220952 C0935630 C0012634 C3272565 C0220952 C0004457 C0349013 C0085110 C0175659 C0222045 C0349674 C0684254 C1550470 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0488480 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C2983285 C0243161 C0012634 C0007222 C0017178 C0004457 C0349013 C0033975 C0005586 C0236788 C0853193 C0270419 C0024713 C1456308 C2937260 C0262926 C2004062 C0036337 C0349201 C0154376 C0683407 C0525045 C0036341 C0003125 C0455505 C2267227 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0549206 C2148613 C3714845 C0006141 C0085762 C0439857 C0086025 C0011546 C0013227 C1254351 C1561542 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C1306620 C1305849 C0180112 C2911690 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C1697779 C0010054 C1956346 C0010068 C0522055 C0262926 C2004062 C0741302 C1457887 C0241889 C0332123 C1397163 C1397164 C2584882 C0011071 C1964022 C0003811 C0861148 C0262926 C2004062 C0018787 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0086565 C0264202 C0201850 C1318717 C1561546 C0373807 C1860130 C1868883 C0036776 C1287353 C0200681 C0201855 C0428332 C0853162 C0151849 C0201851 C0858306 C0552307 C0428441 C0201913 C0863174 C0022661 C1561643 C0201976 C0600061 C0858112 C0428282 C0443343 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C2926606 C0031809 C0944752 C0946068 C2973270 C1444322 C1444324 C0449381 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0443343 C0030695 C0150369 C0181904 C0745031 C0438696 C1551395 C1552745 C0033978 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C0441640 C0087169 C0086189 C0549263 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0012634 C0007222 C0017178 C0262926 C2004062 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0028429 C3809765 C0015393 C0151583 C0151611 C0476403 C0522214 C1832603 C2183966 C2674738 C0558826 C3245491 C1552578 C0013230 C0220825 C1261322 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C3842337 ", "concepts": "Traumatic Stress Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Neuropeptide Y, Study summary, summary intranasal administration, study placebo, controllers, Controlled Medications, medication:, medications:, Premedication, IV medication, Medications, Medications, Asymptomatic, groups criteria, Eligibility Criteria understanding, tests, Etests examination, Examination, required, required, Required, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, informed consent form understanding, documents, Document, document, documents, documented, documented, study procedures, Procedures, study study criteria, dsm-iv Interview, Disorders, Clinical, dsm-iv, Axis, Axis, scid Scales, Scales, Scale, Scaler, clinician screening, Screening, screening, screening, Screening, APS score, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate, Severity Criteria disorders, CV disorders, GI disorders, Axis, Axis psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder nos, bipolar disorder ii, bipolar i disorder, Mild bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder manic, Other bipolar disorder, mixed bipolar disorder, History, History schizoaffective disorder, Other schizoaffective disorders, chronic schizoaffective disorder, bipolar schizoaffective disorder, affective disorder, schizophrenia anorexia nervosa, H/O: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis pregnant, feeding, feeding, breast alcohol abuse, dependence on, Codependence, dependency, Drug, Drug, month hypertension, Hypertension, Prehypertensions, No hypertension, hypertensin, sbp, dbp, controllers, Controlled screening, Screening, screening, screening, Screening, immediate coronary artery diseases, CAD (coronary artery disease), coronary diseases, abnormal ECG, history, history, Atypical symptoms family history, No family history, family history;
