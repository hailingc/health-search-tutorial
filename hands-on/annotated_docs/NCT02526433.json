{"text": "TITLE:\n      Singing Away the Blues: Assessing the Wellbeing of Mothers\nSUMMARY:\n      Post-natal depression (PND) is anticipated to affect 12.9% of new mothers with at least\n      75,000 cases per year in the UK alone. However, despite this, there is currently a worrying\n      lack of support for new mothers, with data suggesting that 64% of healthcare trusts in the\n      UK do not have a strategy for treating PND, and flaws in the current pharmacological and\n      psychological treatment models. Consequently, research into promising psychosocial\n      interventions such as music is critical to developing new paradigms for treating PND.\n      Singing away the Blues is an ambitious programme of research that investigates links between\n      the mental health of women in the later stages of pregnancy and first 9 months post birth\n      and their use of psychosocial interventions including music.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The study uses an online questionnaire to achieve a cross-sectional view of the mental\n      health of women across England in the final stages of pregnancy and the first 9 months post\n      birth, how much and in what ways music is used by these women, and whether there are any\n      associations between music and mental health. The study aims to recruit 1,000 women to take\n      the anonymous questionnaire. However, women who complete the questionnaire while still\n      pregnant will be invited to complete three further questionnaires shortly post-birth and 3\n      months later to gather longitudinal data to analyse change across pregnancy into post-birth\n      (aiming for 500 of the 1,000 undertaking this repeated measurement).\n      Phase A of the study will be open to NHS sites around England to take part.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Women who are more than 26 weeks pregnant OR up to 9 months post-birth\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Outside the limits of the number of weeks pregnant/post birth\n          -  Living outside England\n          -  Refusal to participate\n", "cuis": "C3813622 C3539125 C1552616 C1706244 C0419618 C0011570 C0011581 C0344315 C0812393 C1579931 C1999266 C4049644 C0035143 C0429068 C0429108 C0520887 C0001721 C2237113 C1956415 C1578513 C3840775 C3539125 C0233481 C1561543 C0086388 C3245479 C1578513 C3539125 C0679199 C1956415 C1306597 C0848372 C1458132 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C3845876 C3853906 C0886296 C1948041 C1273869 C2979881 C2183254 C0026867 C1578513 C1956415 C1547298 C1547308 C1551396 C0025353 C0029162 C0025352 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0005615 C1550722 C3245487 C1300072 C1561542 C0886296 C1948041 C1273869 C2979881 C2183254 C1458132 C0026867 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0034394 C1706422 C0815327 C0229992 C0028977 C0947630 C1552858 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C1300072 C1561542 C0005615 C1550722 C3245487 C0026867 C0025353 C0029162 C0025352 C0026867 C0947630 C0004083 C0034394 C1706422 C0815327 C3245483 C1815293 C0034394 C1706422 C3836256 C3836250 C3836251 C3836252 C3836254 C3836255 C0549206 C0005615 C1550722 C3245487 C1815293 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0005615 C1550722 C3245487 C3245479 C0179038 C1561542 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C0947630 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0460089 C1135241 C0005615 C1550722 C3245487 C1561542 C0243161 C0460089 C1135241 C0005615 C1550722 C3245487 ", "concepts": "Wellbeing, others summary, summary Post-natal, Depressions, Depression, depression, depression, depression, Depression, Depression, Repression, PR depression, TU depression, depression st, affect, affect, pnd, new, Anticipated, others worrying, year healthcare, data, new, others strategy, pnd psychological, psychological tic, psychosocial, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, Consequent, model intervention, Intervention, Intervention, Interventions, interventional, music, new, pnd, Critical, Critical, Critical mental health, dental health, mental heal, pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy, births, birth, birth, stage, month intervention, Intervention, Intervention, Interventions, interventional, psychosocial, music description, prescription, prescription questionnaire, Questionnaires, NET questionnaire, mental, Omental, study, section pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy, stage, month births, birth, birth, music mental health, dental health, mental heal, music, study, association questionnaire, Questionnaires, NET questionnaire, Anonymous, Complete questionnaires, Questionnaires, questionnaires ad8, questionnaires moca, questionnaires koos, questionnaires kccq, questionnaires hoos, questionnaires bomc, pregnant, births, birth, birth, Complete pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy, births, birth, birth, data, analyser, month ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement study criteria, Eligibility Criteria weeks pregnant, Weeks pregnant, births, birth, birth, month Criteria weeks pregnant, Weeks pregnant, births, birth, birth "}
