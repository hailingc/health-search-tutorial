{"text": "TITLE:\n      Anti-hypertensive Effect of Mycelia of Antrodia Cinnamomea\nSUMMARY:\n      This the first report undertaken to assess the effect of supplementation with oral\n      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine and antrosterol-containing AC mycelia on blood\n      pressure among people with mild hypertension. Overall, AC mycelia consumption for 8 weeks\n      could successfully reduce mean diastolic and systolic BP through the suppression of PRA that\n      is linked to downstream suppresion of angiotensin II formation, which further decreases the\n      sympathetic outflow that leads to hypertension. In addition to blood pressure lowering\n      properties, AC mycelia also has beneficial effect in reducing oxidative stress,\n      significantly. No adverse events were noted, suggesting that AC mycelia deserve its\n      consideration as a candidate for safe alternative treatment to conventional\n      anti-hypertensive medications.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This the first report undertaken to assess the effect of supplementation with oral\n      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine and antrosterol-containing AC mycelia on blood\n      pressure among people with mild hypertension. Forty-one subjects with systolic blood\n      pressure (SBP) between 130 and 179 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 85\n      and 109 mm Hg were randomized to receive either AC mycelia or starch placebo for 8 weeks,\n      and had follow-up observation for an additional 2 weeks. SBP in the subjects given GABA,\n      adenosine and antrosterol-rich AC mycelia significantly decreased compared to those who\n      received the placebo (p<0.05). DBP also decreased after the intake of AC mycelia. Compared\n      to the placebo, AC mycelia significantly reduced plasma renin activity by a maximum of 25 %\n      and 36 % on week 8. This suppression suggested that AC mycelia is a potent inhibitor of\n      renin, and its bioavailability is sufficient to produce BP reduction after a short term of\n      oral administration. Neither adverse events nor abnormal laboratory findings were noted\n      throughout the study period, suggesting that GABA, adenosine and antrosterol-rich AC mycelia\n      significantly decreased borderline hypertension, which may support its consideration as a\n      safe alternative treatment compared to conventional anti-hypertensive medications.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Eligible subjects were untreated hypertensive men or women aged between 20 and 80\n             years old with SBP between 130 and 179 mmHg and/or DBP between 85 and 109 mmHg as\n             measured in a sitting position\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Subjects were excluded if they had a history of major cardiovascular disease, severe\n             liver dysfunction, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or stroke. They were also\n             excluded if they routinely consumed alcohol, were pregnant or unable to comprehend\n             study instructions.\n", "cuis": "C0857121 C0947663 C0003364 C1552616 C1706244 C0242297 C0556088 C2935799 C2350507 C3537005 C0684224 C0700287 C0220780 C0047220 C0054314 C0001443 C0042646 C0067203 C0070429 C0005768 C0229664 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0460139 C0282416 C1947907 C4071751 C0871470 C0301625 C0728721 C0221103 C0084688 C0522171 C0012000 C0428883 C0003009 C0373546 C0523498 C0003018 C0051863 C0051887 C0051889 C0603886 C1561528 C0301625 C0728721 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0020649 C0725357 C2230142 C0020538 C2926615 C0180208 C0428889 C0428886 C0488053 C0497247 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0181586 C1820370 C0038435 C0877248 C1963761 C0518609 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0684167 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0242297 C0556088 C2935799 C2350507 C3537005 C0684224 C0700287 C0220780 C0047220 C0054314 C0001443 C0042646 C0067203 C0070429 C0005768 C0229664 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0460139 C0005768 C0229664 C0018790 C1995642 C0428883 C1305849 C0488052 C0277890 C0277889 C0488055 C0871470 C1306620 C1319896 C0277887 C1277633 C2183311 C1282161 C1282162 C1282163 C1282175 C1319894 C2183315 C0802999 C4071678 C0277888 C0428885 C1303019 C1840375 C2133960 C2183314 C0460139 C0032042 C0038179 C0478530 C0700325 C0557985 C1964257 C3244317 C1306620 C0001443 C0042646 C0067203 C0070429 C0032827 C0162119 C0239787 C0520831 C0520870 C0728725 C1295611 C1295666 C1295669 C0032042 C1305849 C0032827 C0162119 C0239787 C0520831 C0520870 C0728725 C1295611 C1295666 C1295669 C2041375 C1845206 C0032042 C0301625 C0728721 C0221103 C0084688 C0522171 C1561540 C0069695 C0441610 C0001563 C0678814 C0001560 C1533734 C0587081 C0587095 C0586624 C0586721 C0877248 C1963761 C0013418 C0438217 C0436539 C0853626 C0853735 C0860782 C0860787 C0861001 C0001443 C0042646 C0067203 C0070429 C0025344 C0947630 C0262395 C0518609 C0032827 C0162119 C0239787 C0520831 C0520870 C0728725 C1295611 C1295666 C1295669 C0684167 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0857121 C0947663 C0003364 C0332155 C1306620 C1305849 C0277814 C3166408 C1301304 C0243161 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0558373 C0849932 C0264656 C0042373 C0262926 C2004062 C1552867 C1306232 C0086565 C0011849 C0011878 C0455488 C0743140 C0011860 C1313937 C0021641 C3537244 C0038454 C1299583 C0549206 C0001962 C0001975 C1299582 C1552867 C3273186 C0302828 C0441513 C3263700 C0947630 ", "concepts": "hypertensive, hypertensin, Antihypertensive summary, summary supplementation, Fat supplementation, DTS supplementation, Viscosupplementation, Iron supplementation, reports, reports aminobutyric acid, 3-Aminobutyric acid, alpha-aminobutyric acid, adenosine, araadenosine, AB-adenosine, PI-adenosine, blood, blood hypertension, Hypertension, Prehypertensions, No hypertension, hypertensin, pressure, Overall, Consumption, O2 consumption systolic BP, Suppression, suppression, Suppression, suppressin, oppression, Diastolic, diastolic BP angiotensin ii, Angiotensin II, Angiotensin I, angiotensin, SMT-angiotensin II, NAB angiotensin II, Br5-angiotensin II, SAMP-angiotensin II, Information, suppression, suppression Blood pressure, take blood pressure, blood pressures, low blood pressures, blood pressure kit, blood pressure leg, hypertension, High blood pressure, blood pressure cuff, Cuff blood pressure, mean blood pressure, Mean blood pressure, blood pressure rise, Hypertension, Prehypertensions, No hypertension, hypertensin, leads, flowering stress adverse events, No adverse event consideration, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment hypertensive medications description, prescription, prescription supplementation, Fat supplementation, DTS supplementation, Viscosupplementation, Iron supplementation, reports, reports aminobutyric acid, 3-Aminobutyric acid, alpha-aminobutyric acid, adenosine, araadenosine, AB-adenosine, PI-adenosine, blood, blood hypertension, Hypertension, Prehypertensions, No hypertension, hypertensin, pressure, blood, blood, Asystolic, Bystolic DBP -
