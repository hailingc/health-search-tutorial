{"text": "TITLE:\n      Overnight Weight Loss and Sleep Structure\nSUMMARY:\n      The objectives of the present study are:\n        1. to evaluate if overnight weight loss is dependent on sleep structure assessed by\n           polysomnography;\n        2. to compare weight loss rate during sleep and awake rest;\n        3. to compare night weight loss profile of normal and obese volunteers.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Weight loss can be caused by loss of body mass due to metabolism and by water loss as\n      insensible water loss, sweating, or excretion in feces and urine. Eighty-three percent of\n      the total weight loss is due to insensible water loss from airways and skin. Water loss rate\n      varies according to changes in activity and ambient temperature and humidity. Although\n      weight loss during sleep is a well-known phenomenon, there are no studies relating it to\n      sleep structure or any other functions during the distinct sleep stages, particularly SWS\n      and REM sleep. There is evidence suggesting a homeostatic mechanism for weight control in\n      animal models and humans. This mechanism is thought to be dependent on energy intake, energy\n      expenditure, and environmental conditions. The literature suggests that sleep is important\n      for weight homeostasis on a long term since sleep shortage is associated with overweight\n      status, but overnight weight variation had not yet been studied. Considering these facts, we\n      hypothesized that the overnight weight loss rate is not uniform throughout the sleep period.\n      We also intend to compare weight loss rate during sleep and awake rest.\n      Intervention: Normal and obese volunteers will undergo whole night polysomnography with\n      continuous body weight and temperature register after an adaptation night. After that,\n      volunteers will remain awake resting in bed during the following day for continuous weight\n      and temperature register.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  normal and obese volunteers\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  serious medical or neurological condition\n", "cuis": "C1262477 C0037313 C0723362 C0013144 C1552616 C1706244 C0018017 C2239270 C0947630 C1262477 C0424641 C2911645 C0041667 C3665346 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C1299583 C0220825 C0162701 C0182339 C1262477 C0424641 C2911645 C0041667 C3665346 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C0234422 C1262477 C0424641 C2911645 C0041667 C3665346 C1553386 C0028754 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C1262477 C2911645 C0424641 C3665346 C0025519 C3822292 C0518010 C0556844 C0043047 C0043050 C0221102 C0504085 C0038990 C0015733 C0042036 C0591833 C0043050 C1262477 C0424641 C2911645 C0041667 C3665346 C0178987 C0458827 C2096027 C0020311 C0043047 C1547961 C0222224 C0542496 C1550111 C0029939 C0227898 C0600075 C3668946 C4049938 C1262477 C0424641 C2911645 C0041667 C3665346 C0947630 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C3845898 C0037319 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C0031843 C2605207 C0920298 C2958388 C0037322 C0234451 C1561987 C1328018 C0424589 C1299583 C3540698 C3853906 C0023866 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C0012634 C0497406 C0424653 C1305866 C2053618 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C2246906 C0424653 C1305866 C2053618 C1262477 C0424641 C2911645 C0041667 C3665346 C0025344 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C1262477 C0424641 C2911645 C0041667 C3665346 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C0234422 C0162701 C0182339 C1273869 C1948041 C2979881 C0886296 C0231683 C1550457 C1551394 C1873497 C0028754 C1305866 C0944911 C0000934 C0871212 C0233532 C0886414 C1444662 C0424653 C1305866 C2053618 C0234422 C1561538 C1444662 C0886414 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1553386 C0028754 C0243161 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C2707261 C3845870 ", "concepts": "Weight Loss, Sleep, Sleep, Sleepy summary, summary objective, objective, study Weight loss, height loss, Weight loss, weight low, sight loss, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, Independent, Evaluate polysomnogram, Polysomnographs Weight loss, height loss, Weight loss, weight low, sight loss, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, awake Weight loss, height loss, Weight loss, weight low, sight loss, normal, obese description, prescription, prescription weight loss, Weight loss, height loss, sight loss, metabolism, H2 metabolism, body mass, body massage, water insensible water loss, excretions, Excretion, sweating, feces, urine, Murine insensible water loss, Weight loss, height loss, Weight loss, weight low, sight loss, airway, airway, airway, Water, Waters, Water, hand skin ambient temperature, Ambient temperature, Ovaries, ovaries, Activity, Activity, Activity Weight loss, height loss, Weight loss, weight low, sight loss, studies, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, Uknown sleep stages, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, function, distinctin weight control, rnrx weight control, REM sleep, NREM sleep, Homeostatic mechanism, Therex energy, Independent, animals, model literature, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, condition overweight, weight, weight, weight, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, NO homeostasis weight, weight, weight Weight loss, height loss, Weight loss, weight low, sight loss, period, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep Weight loss, height loss, Weight loss, weight low, sight loss, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, awake polysomnogram, Polysomnographs, Interventions, intervention, Interventions, interventions, Normal, Normal, Normal, Normal, obese body weights, Body weight, adaptation, readaptation, Maladaptation, Temperature, Discontinuous weight, weight, weight, awake, day, Discontinuous Temperature criteria, Eligibility Criteria normal, obese Criteria condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, Neurological, ICU.neurological "}
