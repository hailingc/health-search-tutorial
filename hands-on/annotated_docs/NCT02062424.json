{"text": "TITLE:\n      Diet and Prevention of Ischemic Heart Disease: a Translational Approach\nSUMMARY:\n      The objective of this study is to test the effect of substitution dietary guidelines that\n      are specifically aimed at the prevention of ischemic heart disease (IHD) on the dietary\n      intake in the general Danish population.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      225 participants will be included in the intervention. The intervention is planned to run\n      for six months in a real life setting.\n      The study is a randomized, parallel dietary intervention study. Dietary intake, selected IHD\n      biomarkers and anthropometric measurements will be measured at two visits during the\n      intervention period as well as 6 months after the end of the intervention. The study\n      includes a baseline visit followed by a visit where web based dietary records will be\n      completed by the subjects and blood samples and anthropometrics will be measured.\n      The intervention will consist of information on dietary advice due to the specific IHD\n      dietary guideline or the current national dietary guidelines. The information will be\n      provided to the participants via leaflets and recipes.\n      After the baseline visit the subjects will be randomized to group A, B or C: In group A the\n      subjects will receive dietary advice, according to the specific IHD dietary guideline, in\n      group B the subjects will receive dietary advice according to the current national dietary\n      guidelines and in group C the subjects will be instructed to follow their normal dietary\n      habits.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  healthy men and women aged 30 to 65 years who has one or more self-assessed ischemic\n             heart disease risk factors at screening: physical inactivity, overweight or obese\n             (BMI \u2265 25/m2 ), waist circumference (\u2265 80 cm for women, \u2265 94 cm for men). In\n             addition, the participants should have the motivation and willingness to be\n             randomized to any of the three groups, and to do their best to follow the given\n             protocol .\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  no internet access or no access to a computer, smoking, pregnancy, or breast-feeding\n             or planning to become pregnant within the next 12 months, a history of cardiovascular\n             disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic disease / disorders that may affect the results of\n             the study, substance abuse within the past 12 months, regular alcohol consumption >\n             21 units / week for men or > 14 units/ week for women, allergy or intolerance to food\n             groups in the dietary guidelines, supplements with mega doses of nutrients that can\n             have potential impact on ischemic heart disease risk markers (eg . fish oils).\n", "cuis": "C0151744 C0199176 C0012159 C0040712 C1552616 C1706244 C0162791 C0220845 C0282423 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0947630 C0392366 C0456984 C0151744 C1313980 C0010054 C1510446 C0264694 C0199176 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0600140 C1561542 C3887804 C0086153 C1286104 C0947630 C0151744 C0005516 C1512346 C0423103 C2048307 C3838520 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0025344 C0947630 C1561542 C0034869 C1512346 C0728774 C0178913 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1552740 C0150600 C0740209 C0151744 C3242430 C1561528 C0162791 C0220845 C0282423 C3242430 C1561528 C3854058 C4049936 C0600194 C1555587 C1512346 C1552839 C0728774 C0282423 C0162791 C0220845 C1552740 C0150600 C0740209 C0151744 C0150600 C0740209 C1552839 C3854058 C4049936 C0162791 C0220845 C0282423 C1553386 C1552839 C2242848 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1551994 C0022116 C1113667 C0497406 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0028754 C0031809 C1509143 C3272557 C0455829 C0424683 C0026605 C3900051 C1552839 C3244317 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0243161 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C2148613 C3714845 C0006141 C2081645 C2019038 C3887460 C0007220 C0436125 C0497234 C0262926 C2004062 C1561542 C0011860 C1320657 C0008679 C3494714 C3266261 C0746102 C1290009 C0012634 C0007222 C0017178 C0018609 C0001721 C2237113 C0740858 C0747752 C0013146 C0038577 C0001962 C0001975 C0947630 C1947907 C4071751 C1561542 C0231199 C1744706 C1547317 C0220929 C0231197 C0020517 C0489531 C1527304 C0719113 C0719656 C3247823 C1561540 C3540798 C0162791 C0220845 C0282423 C1552839 C1947943 C0151744 C1313980 C0010054 C1510446 C0264694 C0016157 C0005516 C2222792 ", "concepts": "Ischemic Heart Disease, Prevention, Diet, Translation summary, summary Guidelines, guidelines, guideline, Objective, objective, Objective, study, test, test ihd, FH: Ischemic heart disease, ischaemic heart disease, Acute ischemic heart disease, Chronic ischemic heart disease, prevention description, prescription, prescription interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, run month, upsetting dietary intervention, Dietary intake, study, ihd biomarkers, visit, Eye measurements, ICD measurements, arm measurements interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, period, study, month records, visit, Vaseline blood samples interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, specific, advices, advice, ihd, informational, Information Guideline, guidelines, Guideline, informational, Information, donation, Donation recipes, provider visit, groups, Vaseline Guideline, Guideline, guidelines, specific, advices, advice, ihd advices, advice, groups, donation, Donation Guidelines, guidelines, guideline, normal, groups habits criteria, Eligibility Criteria self, ischemia heart disease risk, overweight, screening, Screening, screening, screening, Screening, obese, Physical, Physical, Physical circumference waist, Chest circumference motivation, Amotivation groups, given Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol Criteria pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy, feeding, feeding, breast planning to become pregnant (history), spouse planning to become pregnant, cardiovascular, cardiovascular drug, cardiovascular exam, Pain;cardiovascular, history, history, month type 2 diabetes, type diabetes, chronic disease, No chronic disease, One chronic disease, chronic disease lung, chronic disease skin, disease, CV disorders, GI disorders, h disease, affect, affect rndx substance abuse, multisubstance abuse, substance abuse drug, substance abuse test, alcohol, alcohol, study, Consumption, O2 consumption, month Intolerance, intolerance, Intolerance, tolerances, tolerances, allergy, allergy, allergy, Callergy, dallergy, Dallergy, week, food Guidelines, guidelines, guideline, groups, Supplement IHD - Ischemic heart disease, FH: Ischemic heart disease, ischaemic heart disease, Acute ischemic heart disease, Chronic ischemic heart disease, fish oils, marker, OT potential "}
