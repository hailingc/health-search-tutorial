{"text": "TITLE:\n      BNP Testing in Patients With SOB on Presentation to ED\nSUMMARY:\n      A trial to examine whether a new heart failure blood test can improve the outcome of\n      patients presenting to the Emergency Department with shortness of breath.\n      We hypothesise that a BNP test performed in real-time in patients presenting to the\n      Emergency Department with shortness of breath will help identify additional patients with\n      CHF and consequently to change practice and allow more patients to recieve correct treatment\n      earlier.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      In recent years new tests to diagnose heart failure have become available. We are evaluating\n      a new test called B-type natriuretic peptide(BNP)in patients presenting to the Emergency\n      Department with shortness of breath. Patients are randomised into whether they will receive\n      the new test or not. In the patient group where the test is positive, standardised approach\n      that will optimise heart failure treatment will be introduced. We hypothesise that with this\n      approach we will improve the clinical care of patients who present to the Emergency\n      Department with shortness of breath. Measures of outcomes will be the accuracy of diagnosis\n      2 hours after presentation, 30 day mortality, hospital and ICU admission rates and quality\n      of life at 30days.\n      We plan to investigate 600 consecutive patient presenting to the to the Emergency Department\n      with shortness of breath that are over 40 years old and present with an emergency department\n      triage category of 3 or higher. Patients presenting with a traumatic cause of dyspnea,\n      patients with severe renal disease, patients with cardiogenic shock and patients who have\n      early transfer to another hospital(within 24 hrs) will be excluded.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n        We plan to include all patients presenting to the ED with shortness of breath that are\n        over 40 years old and present with an emergency department triage category of 3 or higher.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n        Patients presenting with a traumatic cause of dyspnea, patients with severe renal disease\n        (serum creatinine level of more than 250 micro mmol/L, patients with cardiogenic shock,\n        and patients who have an early transfer to another hospital (within 24 hrs) will be\n        excluded.\n", "cuis": "C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0018801 C0018802 C0018941 C1578513 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0018792 C0013404 C2707305 C4054349 C0748649 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0392366 C0456984 C0013404 C2707305 C4054349 C0748649 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C1552861 C1144890 C3858576 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0237607 C3245512 C0442739 C1548568 C1254223 C0612923 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0018801 C0018802 C0011900 C0392366 C3850116 C1578513 C0597421 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0392366 C0456984 C1578513 C0013404 C2707305 C4054349 C0748649 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0392366 C0456984 C1578513 C1552839 C1514241 C0162643 C0018787 C0456642 C0237428 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0580931 C3272565 C0013404 C2707305 C4054349 C0748649 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0184666 C0809949 C1561538 C0233256 C1389312 C0729829 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0013404 C2707305 C4054349 C0748649 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0578010 C0683312 C0456532 C0456533 C1275857 C0013404 C2024878 C0040861 C2193430 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0036980 C0022658 C0001621 C1857414 C1306232 C0728827 C0040671 C1552867 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0013404 C2707305 C4054349 C0748649 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0683312 C0456532 C0456533 C1275857 C0040861 C2193430 C0578010 C0243161 C0022658 C0001621 C1857414 C0013404 C2024878 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1306232 C0201976 C0600061 C2229679 C0428282 C0428279 C1318439 C0036980 C0728827 C0040671 C1552867 ", "concepts": "Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary heart failures, Heart failure, blood test, new, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined, Atrial shortness of breath (SOB), Shortness of breath, No shortness of breath, shortness of breath rest, Emergency, Emergency, emergency, emergency, Emergency OB test, test shortness of breath (SOB), Shortness of breath, No shortness of breath, shortness of breath rest, Emergency, Emergency, emergency, emergency, Emergency OB, help, Additional patient, deidentify Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, practices, practice, No change, No change, mallow, correctol description, prescription, prescription heart failures, Heart failure, diagnose, tests, Etests, new natriuretic, Emergency, Emergency, emergency, emergency, Emergency OB, test, test, new shortness of breath (SOB), Shortness of breath, No shortness of breath, shortness of breath rest, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient test, test, new, groups, Positive failure treatment, heart, introducer, optimism Emergency, Emergency, emergency, emergency, Emergency OB, care, Clinical shortness of breath (SOB), Shortness of breath, No shortness of breath, shortness of breath rest, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis admissions, Admission, day, malpresentation, leg presentation, urates Emergency, Emergency, emergency, emergency, Emergency OB shortness of breath (SOB), Shortness of breath, No shortness of breath, shortness of breath rest, emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, Hand present category, N category, M category, S category, dyspnea, dyspnea, triage, triage, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient cardiogenic shock, renal disease, Adrenal disease, No renal disease, severed transfers, Transfer, exclude criteria, Eligibility Criteria shortness of breath (SOB), Shortness of breath, No shortness of breath, shortness of breath rest emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, category, N category, M category, S category, triage, triage, Hand present Criteria renal disease, Adrenal disease, No renal disease, dyspnea, dyspnea, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, severed serum creatinine, serum creatinine, serum creatine level, serum creatinine low, creatinine level, creatinine level, cardiogenic shock transfers, Transfer exclude "}
