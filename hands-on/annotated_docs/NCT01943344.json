{"text": "TITLE:\n      Safety and Performance Study of Large Hole Vascular Closure Device\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this Clinical Investigation is to gather feasibility data on the clinical use\n      of the VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE\u2122 in relation to safety, and to confirm its performance to\n      percutaneously close femoral arterial puncture sites in the range of 18-24 F, post\n      endovascular procedures.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This study will be a prospective, multi-centred, non-randomized pilot study to investigate\n      the safety and performance of the VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE\u2122. All patients undergoing a\n      procedure requiring an arteriotomy in the range of 18 to 24 F, via the common femoral artery\n      will be screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the patient meets the\n      requirements of the clinical investigation, they shall be invited to participate, provide\n      informed consent and shall subsequently be assigned a subject number.\n      Patient safety will be monitored closely by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).\n      Safety data will be reported to the DSMC for every patient with a reported complication. The\n      DSMC will adjudicate on the safety data to determine whether it is safe to continue\n      enrolment.\n      Subjects shall have a 1, 3 and 12 month follow-up assessment. Safety data from the\n      follow-ups will be assessed by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee.\n      This protocol will adopt the VARC-2 definitions for major vascular complication associated\n      with closure of the access site.\n      This pilot study will enrol approximately 10 subjects. The study is designed to support a\n      larger CE Mark study. As such, a study safety assessment will be complete when all patients\n      have completed their 1 month follow-up assessment. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee\n      (DSMC) will review all complications and recommend whether it is safe to proceed to the CE\n      Mark study. All patients will continue to be followed at 1, 3 and 12 month follow-ups.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Over 18 years of age.\n          -  Each patient, or his or her guardian or legal representative, is willing to give\n             informed consent.\n          -  Clinically indicated for an endovascular procedure involving access through the\n             femoral artery, with an access puncture of 18 - 24 F.\n          -  Females who are not pregnant or lactating, and not planning to become pregnant \u2264 12\n             months. A pregnancy test may be performed to confirm this.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n        There will be no exclusion of patients from this trial in respect of race, co-existent\n        disease or concomitant therapy, with the exception of those listed below.\n          -  Severe acute non-cardiac systemic disease or terminal illness with a life expectancy\n             of less than one year.\n
