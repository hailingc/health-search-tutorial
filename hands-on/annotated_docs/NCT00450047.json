{"text": "TITLE:\n      Study on the Efficacy of Speed-Feedback Therapy for Elderly People With Dementia\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy of speed-feedback therapy in improving\n      the cognitive function of elderly people with dementia by a randomized controlled trial, and\n      to demonstrate how that affects ADL and QOL.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Dementia is a syndrome caused by diseases of the cerebral parenchyma, and it is a state in\n      which cognitive functions, including attention, memory, thinking, comprehension, judgment,\n      and computation, are diminished. Because of the mental symptoms, problem behaviors, and\n      decreased activities of daily living (ADL) it is also recognized as a major social problem.\n      However, rehabilitation of elderly people with dementia is still at the trial-and-error\n      stage, and establishing a method of rehabilitation is an urgent task. In 2004, the authors\n      devised and created a training method that integrates exercise therapy with feedback therapy\n      to treat the cognitive dysfunction of elderly people with dementia. To do so the authors\n      introduced speed-feedback therapy with a bicycle ergometer as a feedback therapy\n      intervention. The results of a preliminary study of the efficacy of this method in improving\n      cognitive dysfunction in 17 elderly persons with dementia showed improvement in cognitive\n      dysfunction, and their attentiveness also improved, suggesting that the impaired\n      attentiveness may have improved in response to treatment by this method and, as a result,\n      have led to improvement of cognitive dysfunction. However, it became clear that it would be\n      necessary to further improve and develop the system, and to demonstrate its efficacy in a\n      controlled trial and verify associations between improvement of cognitive dysfunction and\n      improvement of the ADL of dementia patients and their quality of life (QOL).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          1. 65 years of age or older\n          2. Diagnosed with dementia by a physician\n          3. Mini-Mental State Examination score of 23 points or less\n          4. Capable of participating at least once a week for 6 weeks in succession\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          1. Management of a medical risk required\n          2. Impaired ability to pedal the ergometer because of an orthopedic or surgical disease\n             of the lower extremities or central nerve paralysis\n          3. Never having been on a bicycle, and incapable of pedaling well\n", "cuis": "C2911691 C0497327 C0011265 C0087111 C1363945 C1510538 C0947630 C1552616 C1706244 C0087111 C0033972 C0947630 C2911691 C0282440 C0392335 C2237115 C0392334 C2237374 C0011265 C0497327 C0001721 C2237113 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0933845 C0497327 C0011265 C0039082 C0206064 C0796095 C0796110 C2936859 C2936904 C0012634 C0006104 C0228174 C0392335 C2237115 C0392334 C2237374 C2371932 C2266643 C0162340 C3542413 C0004268 C0424101 C0039869 C0022423 C0025260 C0700327 C0233401 C0586405 C0677505 C0033213 C2081614 C0002688 C1546539 C2242847 C0451239 C0509063 C0203978 C0451039 C0451227 C3694100 C0582381 C3484221 C4034307 C1387108 C3649805 C0037431 C0032827 C0162119 C0239787 C0520831 C0520870 C0728725 C1295611 C1295666 C1295669 C0007237 C0034991 C0018459 C4042802 C0204096 C0204601 C0728952 C0419104 C0458264 C0011265 C0497327 C0018792 C0007237 C0034991 C0018459 C4042802 C0204096 C0204601 C0728952 C0419104 C0458264 C0025663 C0025664 C1300072 C0452240 C0087111 C0033972 C0025663 C0025664 C0442694 C1554161 C2911691 C0338656 C0011265 C0497327 C0180748 C0087111 C0033972 C0456642 C2911691 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0025663 C0025664 C0947630 C1716046 C0338656 C0011265 C0497327 C3844714 C0233415 C0233413 C0277785 C1561611 C0521982 C0438286 C0184784 C1320680 C0438285 C1275833 C0025663 C0025664 C0233415 C0233413 C1561611 C0338656 C3844714 C2363670 C0338656 C0004083 C0180112 C2911690 C3844714 C0018792 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C0011265 C0497327 C3844714 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1555709 C1948032 C0011900 C0011265 C0497327 C0804815 C0031809 C0582103 C2328206 C1951419 C1561540 C0243161 C3245501 C3245502 C1619636 C0376636 C0180748 C0012634 C0018609 C0016504 C0543467 C0587668 C0023216 C0230420 C0226813 C0239340 C0262576 C0271355 C0271375 C0877397 C0919940 C1550518 C0392183 C0518505 C0522772 C1548746 ", "concepts": "Feedback, Dementias, dementia, Therapy, Therapy, E-Therapy, Study summary, summary therapy, Cotherapy, study, Feedback randomized controlled trial, Cognitive functioning, cognitive functions, cognitive functioning, no cognitive function, dementia, dementia affect, affect description, prescription, prescription parenchyma, Dementias, dementia, syndrome, syndrome X, syndrome c, W syndrome, N syndrome, G syndrome, diseases, cerebral, Cerebral Cognitive functioning, cognitive functions, cognitive functioning, no cognitive function, Basic cognitive functions, cognitive functions memory, comprehension, Comprehension, attention, Inattention, thinking, judgment, memory, memory mental symptom, Mental symptom, behaviors, problem, problem:, amputation, Amputation activities of daily living (history), Katz activities of daily living, rnrx activities of daily living, Teach activities of daily living, Brief activities of daily living, Index of activities of daily living, activities of daily living goals, Assess activities of daily living, Activities of daily living score, Activities of daily living panel, training; activities of daily living, change in activities of daily living, social problem, K+ decreased, Hb decreased, GH decreased, VC decreased, CI decreased, pH decreased, LH decreased, T4 decreased, T3 decreased rehabilitation, care rehabilitation, habilitation, Telerehabilitations, Neurorehabilitation, drug rehabilitation, drug rehabilitation, Oral rehabilitation, Pain rehabilitation, dementia, dementia, Atrial rehabilitation, care rehabilitation, habilitation, Telerehabilitations, Neurorehabilitation, drug rehabilitation, drug rehabilitation, Oral rehabilitation, Pain rehabilitation, method, methods, stage exercise therapy, therapy, Cotherapy, method, methods, Straining, Training, Feedback cognitive dysfunction, dementia, dementia ergometer, therapy, Cotherapy, introducer, Feedback interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, method, methods, study, Dx preliminary cognitive dysfunction, dementia, dementia, No improvement Inattentiveness, Attentiveness, Dysfunction, Improved Response to treatment NOS, Absent response to treatment, Fair response to treatment, Poor response to treatment, Slight response to treatment, Partial response to treatment, method, methods, Inattentiveness, Attentiveness, Improved cognitive dysfunction, No improvement developer cognitive dysfunction, association, controllers, Controlled, No improvement, Atrial Quality of life, quality of life, Poor quality of life, dementia, dementia, No improvement criteria, Eligibility Criteria folder, Folder Diagnosed, dementia, dementia, Physician examination, Examination, Mentale, Statex week Criteria required, required, Required, management ergometer, disease, h disease, pedal, Surgical, Surgical lower extremities, Both lower extremities, veins lower extremities, lower extremities edema, nerve paralysis, VIth nerve paralysis, IVth nerve paralysis, XIth nerve paralysis, IXth nerve paralysis incapable, pedaling, shaving, shaving, Shaving "}
