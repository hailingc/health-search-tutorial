{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effect of Systemic Hypoxia and Hyperoxia on Retinal Oxygen Saturation\nSUMMARY:\n      Adequate perfusion and oxygenation is essential for the function of the inner retina.\n      Although it is known that oxygen tension is very well autoregulated in the retina, the\n      physiological mechanisms behind this regulation process are not fully explored. The\n      development of new instruments for the non-invasive measurement of oxygen tension in retinal\n      vessels now allows for the more precise investigation of these physiological processes. The\n      current study seeks to evaluate the retinal oxygen saturation in healthy subjects while\n      breathing different oxygen mixtures to achieve a hypoxic and a hyperoxic state.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Men and women aged between 18 and 35 years\n          -  Nonsmokers\n          -  Normal findings in the medical history and physical examination unless the\n             investigator considers an abnormality to be clinically irrelevant\n          -  Normal laboratory values unless the investigator considers an abnormality to be\n             clinically irrelevant\n          -  Normal ophthalmic findings, ametropy < 3 Dpt.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Regular use of medication, abuse of alcoholic beverages, participation in a clinical\n             trial in the 3 weeks preceding the study (except oral contraceptive)\n          -  Symptoms of a clinically relevant illness in the 3 weeks before the first study day\n          -  Presence of any form of anemia\n          -  Blood donation during the previous 3 weeks\n          -  Pregnancy\n", "cuis": "C0523807 C0746961 C0852710 C0242706 C0242184 C1963140 C0035298 C0035331 C0024622 C0154027 C1278894 C1552616 C1706244 C0031001 C0035124 C4038407 C0031843 C1705273 C0035298 C0035331 C0593762 C0412792 C0202155 C1536627 C0035298 C0035331 C0593762 C3845898 C1328723 C0180799 C0202155 C1536627 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0348000 C0035298 C0035331 C1578513 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C1334278 C0031845 C1327471 C1552578 C3245491 C0220825 C1261322 C0005847 C0523807 C2237091 C0746961 C1821453 C0035298 C0035331 C0947630 C0220825 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0242184 C0030054 C0184633 C0242706 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0337672 C0150618 C1548377 C0199200 C2148584 C0420160 C0199190 C0199202 C1548379 C0199189 C0231683 C1550457 C1551394 C1873497 C2926606 C1704258 C3809765 C0231683 C1550457 C1551394 C1873497 C1704258 C3809765 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C0015392 C0014236 C0231683 C1550457 C1551394 C1873497 C2926606 C0243161 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C3695181 C3272565 C0009905 C0029151 C0274536 C0481121 C1268907 C0009906 C0947630 C0018792 C1457887 C3854129 C1706867 C0221423 C0424228 C0947630 C1561538 C0392148 C0002871 C0005794 C0155668 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 ", "concepts": "Blood Oxygen Saturation, Low Oxygen Saturation, Oxygen Saturation, High, Hyperoxia, Hypoxias, Hypoxia, Retina, Retinal, Retina, Retina, Retina summary, summary perfusion, Reperfusion, CT.perfusion, function, Function, retina, retinal, retin, Preoxygenation Oxygen tension, oxygen tension, retina, retinal, retin, Uknown Coagulation process, explorer Oxygen tension, oxygen tension, development, Development, Development, Development, No development, instruments, retinal, retinal, new, ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement, Invasive physiological processes, neurophysiological process, investigation, investigational, Investigation, Investigation, vessels oxygen saturation test, oxygen saturation, Low oxygen saturation, Oxygen saturation>85%, retinal, retinal, study, Evaluate in breathing, Breathing, breathing, Rebreathing, hypoxic, oxygen, oxygen, hyperoxia criteria, Eligibility Criteria Nonsmoker History and physical examination, NOS, History and physical examination, History and physical examination, camp, history and physical exam, History and physical examination, school, History and physical examination, limited, History and physical examination, license, Psychiatric history and physical examination, History and physical examination, complete, Normal, Normal, Normal, Normal, Findings Abnormality, No abnormality Normal, Normal, Normal, Normal, Abnormality, No abnormality, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory ophthalmic, ophthalmia, Normal, Normal, Normal, Normal, Findings Criteria Medications, medication:, medications:, Premedication, IV medication, Medications, Medications, avoid alcoholic beverages, Clinical oral contraceptive pill, oral contraceptive pill, Oral contraceptives, Oral contraceptives, Non-oral contraceptive, oral contraceptive pill, study, Atrial Symptom, Symptom, B-Symptoms, illness, Stillness, study, day Presence, anemia Blood donation, previous MI pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
