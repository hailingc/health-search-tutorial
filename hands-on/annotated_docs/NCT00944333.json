{"text": "TITLE:\n      Second Generation\" Drug-Eluting Stents Implantation Followed by Six Versus Twelve-Month - Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\nSUMMARY:\n      Prospective, randomized, non-inferiority, multicenter, international study.In total 4000\n      patients (70 centers in Europe) with de novo lesions in native coronary arteries who meet\n      the eligibility criteria randomized to 6 versus 12 month dual antiplatelet therapies\n      following a second generation DES implantation.\n      Assuming that the true proportion of thrombotic events is equal to 2.3% for both regimens\n      (6-month and 12-month clopidogrel) 2000 patients for each treatment group are necessary to\n      demonstrate a non-inferiority of the 6-months regimen if the proportion of thrombotic events\n      will be no more than 3.5% with a power of 0.80 and a significance level of 0.05 (one-tail).\n      If the non-inferiority hypothesis will be rejected, the superiority hypothesis (12-months\n      regimen is superior to the 6-months-regimen) will be tested at a significance level of 0.05\n      (two-tails).\n      The maximal not clinically relevant difference for the non-inferiority hypothesis of 1.2 %\n      more thrombotic events has to be considered together with the lower expected number of\n      bleeding events in the 6-months regimen.\n      All the analysis will be done as \"intention-to-treat\" analysis.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society\n             Classification
