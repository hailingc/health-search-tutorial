{"text": "TITLE:\n      Research With Retinal Cells Derived From Stem Cells for Myopic Macular Degeneration\nSUMMARY:\n      Pathologic myopia is a major cause of legal blindness worldwide. In myopic macular\n      degeneration (MMD), there is degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer, and\n      associated photoreceptors, resulting in vision loss. There is currently no standard\n      treatment for MMD.\n      Transplantation of intact sheets of RPE and suspensions of isolated individual RPE cells as\n      well as autologous translocation of RPE cells has been attempted as treatment for AMD. Human\n      photoreceptors are comprised of two cell types-rods and cones. Both have a close\n      relationship with the outermost retinal cells, the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). The\n      RPE is located between the choroid and the photoreceptors. The RPE maintains photoreceptor\n      function by recycling photopigments,delivering, metabolizing and storing vitamin A,\n      phagocytosing rod photoreceptor outer segments, transporting iron and small molecules\n      between retina and choroid, maintaining Bruch's membrane and absorbing stray light to allow\n      better image resolution. In essence, the RPE layer is critical to the function and health of\n      photoreceptors and the retina as a whole.\n      Human PRE (hRPE) transplantation may be a viable option for treatment of degenerative\n      diseases of the retina.\n      MA09-hRPE cells are fully differentiated human RPE cells derived from embryonic stem cells.\n      Transplanted hRPE cells prepared by Advanced Cell Technology have been studied in rodent\n      models of macular degenerative disease. The data suggests that the subretinal injection of\n      ACT's hRPE cell products rescues, or at least delays, loss of visual function in two animal\n      models of retinal degenerative diseases.\n      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MA09-hRPE\n      cellular therapy in patients with Myopic Macular Degeneration (MMD). Another objective is to\n      evaluate potential efficacy endpoints to be used in future studies of RPE cellular therapy.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Adult male or female over 40 years of age.\n          -  Patient should be in sufficiently good health to reasonably expect survival for at\n             least four years after treatment\n          -  Axial myopia of equal to or greater than -8 diopters and/or axial length equal to or\n             greater than 28 mm\n          -  Clinical findings consistent with MMD with evidence of one or more areas of\n             >250microns of geographic atrophy (as defined in the Age-Related eye Disease Study\n             [AREDS] study) involving the central fovea.\n          -  GA defined as attenuation or loss of RPE as observed by biomicroscopy, OCT, and FA.\n          -  No evidence of current or prior choroidal neovascularization\n          -  The visual acuity of the eye to receive the transplant will be no better than 20/80.\n          -  The visual acuity of the eye that is NOT to receive the transplant will be no worse\n             than 20/400.\n          -  The eye with the more advanced disease and worse vision will be the study eye.\n          -  Electrophysiological findings consistent with macula-involving geographic atrophy.\n          -  Medically suitable to undergo vitrectomy and subretinal injection.\n          -  Medically suitable for general anesthesia or waking sedation, if needed.\n          -  Medically suitable for transplantation of an embryonic stem cell line:\n        Any laboratory value, which falls slightly outside of the normal range, will be reviewed\n        by the Medical Monitor and Investigators to determine its clinical significance.
