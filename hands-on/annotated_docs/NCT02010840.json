{"text": "TITLE:\n      The Effect of a Father Inclusive Psychoeducation Program on Postnatal Depression\nSUMMARY:\n      Study hypothesis: Childbearing couples who receive the father inclusive psychoeducation\n      program will have: (a) a lower level of depressive symptoms, (b) a higher level of marital\n      relationship, and (c) a higher level of quality of life at 6 weeks, 6 months and one year\n      postpartum than those who receive the usual perinatal care.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Background: Having a first child is a key marker of the transition into parenthood that\n      requires substantial adjustment of couples' life. A recent meta-analysis published in the\n      Journal of American Medical Association reports that both women (23.8%) and men (10.4%)\n      suffer from perinatal depression [1]. The father's involvement during pregnancy can\n      positively influence health outcomes not only for the man, but his partner, and their\n      children [1,2]. However, the effectiveness of father's involvement in prenatal care in\n      preventing paternal and maternal depression, is still unknown.\n      Aims: This study seeks to: (1) evaluate the effect of a father inclusive psychoeducation\n      program for first-time Chinese mothers and fathers on depressive symptoms (primary outcome),\n      marital relationships and quality of life at 6 weeks, 6 months and one year postpartum; and\n      (2) explore fathers' involvement, their perceived benefits of participating in the program\n      and factors influencing the effectiveness of the program.\n      Methods: This study employs a longitudinal, randomized, pre and post-test design. A\n      convenience sample of 576 couples will be recruited at antenatal clinics and randomly\n      assigned to one of three groups: (1) the experimental group with both couples receives the\n      intervention on top of usual perinatal care; (2) the comparison group with only the women\n      receives the intervention on top of usual perinatal care; and (3) the control group receives\n      usual perinatal care only. The intervention consists of a single 3-hour session during\n      pregnancy and two telephone follow-up at postpartum week one and week two. Primary outcome\n      on postnatal depression will be assessed by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Secondary\n      outcomes on marital relationship and quality of life will be assessed by Dyadic Adjustment\n      Scale and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12-item Health Survey, respectively, at\n      baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months and one year postpartum. Process evaluation will be conducted at\n      6 weeks postpartum using individual telephone interview on 20 couples randomly selected from\n      the experimental group.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  aged 18 or above;\n          -  first-time parents;\n          -  able to speak and read the Chinese language; and\n          -  Hong Kong residents.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  couples with past or family psychiatric history\n", "cuis": "C0221074 C2728259 C0376691 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C0086132 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C1561543 C1561542 C0459867 C0242963 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0005516 C0282458 C2945673 C0281902 C1704324 C3245501 C3245502 C0004083 C0086168 C0162443 C0199168 C1561579 C0684224 C0700287 C0011570 C0011581 C0344315 C0812393 C1579931 C1999266 C4049644 C0035143 C0429068 C0429108 C0520887 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0683278 C0033052 C0722758 C3656118 C0011570 C0011581 C0344315 C0812393 C1579931 C1999266 C4049644 C0035143 C0429068 C0429108 C0520887 C1858460 C0721591 C1556133 C3541433 C0947630 C0220825 C0086132 C3539125 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C1561543 C1561542 C0030971 C0180799 C0814287 C0025663 C2827714 C2828387 C0557351 C0947630 C0392366 C0456984 C0441621 C1552601 C1552839 C0242963 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1552839 C0242963 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1552839 C0242963 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0087136 C0723338 C0233697 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0439631 C1561540 C1576871 C1626258 C3273808 C0451144 C3481520 C3699271 C0221074 C0342069 C0342071 C0027627 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C0459867 C2945673 C0199168 C1561579 C0038951 C0175659 C0222045 C0349674 C0684254 C0947630 C2964478 C1328956 C2718080 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C1184743 C1951340 C1561543 C1561542 C0728774 C0935630 C1576871 C1626258 C3273808 C0021228 C1552839 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0600116 C1299581 C1705179 C0033348 C2706915 C0243161 C0262926 C2004062 C1548428 C3526598 ", "concepts": "Postnatal Depression, Program, Programs summary, summary Study depressive symptoms Quality of life, quality of life, Poor quality of life, year, month, New relationship perinatal care description, prescription, prescription marker meta-analysis, adjustments, maladjustment, Published, required, required Association, Dissociation, Journal, Medical, Medical, report, report Depressions, Depression, depression, depression, depression, Depression, Depression, Repression, PR depression, TU depression, depression st, pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy, suffer prenatal care, Prenatal care, No prenatal care Depressions, Depression, depression, depression, depression, Depression, Depression, Repression, PR depression, TU depression, depression st, Maternal, materna, unknown, unknown study, Evaluate depressive symptoms, others Quality of life, quality of life, Poor quality of life, year, month perceived, explorer factors influence Method, Method, Method, employs, study, test, test sampled assigned, groups perinatal care, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, groups perinatal care, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, groups perinatal care, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, single, singlet, Obsession pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy, Primary, week, Telephone, Telephone, Telephone Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale set, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS], postnatal depression, Mild postnatal depression, Severe postnatal depression, secondary Quality of life, quality of life, Poor quality of life, New relationship, adjustments Medical, Medical, Survey, Scales, Scales, Scale, Scaler, Study, Short Forms, eHealth, mHealth Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, Processus, Process, year, month, Vaseline interview, Telephone, Telephone, Telephone, individuality groups criteria, Eligibility Criteria speak, able, read, Language, Language Criteria history, history, Psychiatric, Psychiatric "}
