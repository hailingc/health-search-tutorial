{"text": "TITLE:\n      Improving Hand Use in Multiple Sclerosis\nSUMMARY:\n      This study will compare two different kinds of physical therapy to improve use of the hands\n      in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). One treatment will be Constraint-Induced\n      Movement therapy (CI therapy), the other will be a set of Complementary and Alternative\n      Medicine (CAM) treatments (yoga, relaxation exercises, aquatherapy, massage). The study will\n      determine which of the two forms of treatment is more successful for improving hand use.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) frequently causes reduced use of one of the hands, and as a result,\n      much of daily living activities are conducted only by the other hand, leaving the person\n      effective one-handed. Nonetheless, reduced hand use can be improved for extended amounts of\n      time with specific forms of physical therapy, as long as persons with MS have the ability to\n      perform the training tasks.\n      This study will randomize persons with MS who have relatively reduced use of one of the\n      hands to either CI therapy or CAM treatments. Treatment in either program will be for 2\n      consecutive weeks, 3.5 hours per day (Monday-Friday), under the direct supervision of a\n      specially trained therapist. Before starting, participants will also undergo comprehensive\n      medical and physical exam screening and brain MRI scan. The same evaluations will be\n      performed after treatment to learn whether any of these have changed as a result of\n      treatment.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  diagnosis of non-relapsing multiple sclerosis (primary progressive MS, secondary\n             progressive MS)\n          -  reduced use of one of the hands because of MS\n          -  ability to pick up and release a small object with the more-affected hand when\n             requested\n          -  can travel to the treatment program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)\n          -  can undergo treatment for 2 weeks (Monday-Friday), 3.5 hours per day\n          -  can undergo MRI scan\n          -  any kind of medication used for MS is allowed except spasticity medicine\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  disease relapse in the past 3 months\n          -  pregnancy\n          -  marked pain with arm movement\n          -  severe uncontrolled medical illness\n          -  simultaneous treatment with another form of physical therapy\n", "cuis": "C0026769 C0018563 C1281583 C1947944 C1552616 C1706244 C0029709 C0949766 C0553651 C0204093 C1948126 C2064714 C2148126 C0947630 C0018563 C0026769 C0338475 C0455388 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0454279 C0087111 C0033972 C0036849 C1148475 C1456846 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C0814472 C0452240 C0013227 C3243280 C0024875 C3536731 C0947630 C1883583 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0018563 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0026769 C0018563 C2239122 C2004436 C0018563 C0018563 C1561611 C0029709 C0949766 C0553651 C0204093 C1948126 C2064714 C2148126 C1552740 C0442694 C1554161 C0947630 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C0814472 C1533734 C0746919 C0033972 C0018563 C0038842 C3244286 C1561538 C0080194 C0031809 C0220825 C1261322 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0412675 C0881827 C0441633 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0023185 C0442739 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0026769 C0338475 C0455388 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0027627 C3839460 C3839460 C0018563 C1963578 C0018563 C1553888 C0679841 C1555670 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1561538 C0024485 C0034606 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C0026838 C0243161 C0012634 C0018609 C0277556 C1561542 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0030193 C0446516 C1140618 C0026649 C0221423 C0424228 C1306232 C0029709 C0949766 C0553651 C0204093 C1948126 C2064714 C2148126 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 ", "concepts": "Multiple Sclerosis, Hand, Hand, Use summary, summary physical;
