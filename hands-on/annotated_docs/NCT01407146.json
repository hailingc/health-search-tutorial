{"text": "TITLE:\n      Acute Coronary Syndrome and Care-Seeking Delay: A Web Based Behavioral Study\nSUMMARY:\n      The primary aim of this study is to increase our understanding of care-seeking behavior\n      surrounding heart attacks or acute coronary syndromes [ACS]. This study uses an internet\n      based survey to ask individuals how they obtained medical care in the midst of a heart\n      attack. At present, care-seeking delay among individuals stricken with a heart attack\n      prevents them from obtaining the full therapeutic benefit of hospital based medical care in\n      a timely manner to reduce the long term health consequences of a heart attack. By using a\n      self-tailoring survey instrument the study attempts to take into consideration the complex\n      social processes by which the individual and their family make decisions to seek medical\n      care for symptoms of a heart attack. The study is designed to obtain a national sample of\n      ACS care-seeking behavior in the United States.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The primary aim of this study is to increase our understanding of care-seeking behavior\n      surrounding acute coronary syndromes [ACS] through the application and testing of an\n      integrated self-regulatory care-seeking model [ISCM] and the utilization of a world wide web\n      [WWW] based ISCM survey instrument. At present, care-seeking delay among individuals\n      stricken with ACS [acute myocardial infarction [AMI], unstable angina or sudden cardiac\n      death] prevents many patients from obtaining the full therapeutic benefit of hospital based\n      thrombolytic and/or mechanical reperfusion therapy to reduce the morbid and mortal\n      consequences of acute cardiovascular disease [CVD]. Results from prior studies of ACS\n      care-seeking delay generally rely on measures of time duration from acute symptom onset\n      [ASO] to hospital emergency department [ED] arrival and measures of social demographic and\n      clinical variables, extracted from emergency medical system [EMS] logs and/or ED charts. By\n      relying on such limited data sources, these studies have failed to take into consideration\n      the complexity of the social and behavioral processes by which individuals make decisions to\n      seek medical care for symptoms of ACS.\n      By applying and testing an integrated self-regulatory care-seeking model [ISCM] to ACS\n      care-seeking, it will be possible to delineate decision points and situations and\n      circumstances that are critical to producing patterns of care-seeking that are efficient and\n      expeditious or are protracted and delayed. The care-seeking process in the ISCM is viewed in\n      terms of five analytic care-seeking phases from warning or premonitory symptoms to ED\n      arrival. By noting the presence or absence of three central phases, it is possible to\n      distinguish patterns of care-seeking and to record the duration of each care-seeking phase\n      and total duration of each care-seeking path to the ED. The ISCM assumes that coping\n      behaviors emerge over time and initially care-seeking behaviors are guided by demographic\n      and structural factors. As the self-regulatory and coping processes emerge over the course\n      of the ACS episode, the influence of these factors diminishes and emergent ACS evaluations,\n      advice from others and health care providers, emerging symptoms and emotions, come to\n      dominate the care-seeking process and directly determine the duration of ACS care-seeking.\n      The study will test and explore the following hypotheses:\n        1. Commonly used demographic variables, such as, age, sex, education and race will prove\n           to be only one component, along with social situational and circumstantial, cognitive\n           and emotional variables, that significantly influence the course and duration of ACS\n           care-seeking.\n        2. The ISCM will show that decision process variables associated with the care-seeking\n           phases, the Self, Lay and Health Care Provider Phases, as shown in the Figure, are\n           important predictors of time from symptoms onset to ED arrival and in the prediction of\n           the length of time spent in each care-seeking phase.\n        3. The ISCM will show differences in the total duration of the 5 most frequently occurring\n           care-seeking paths to the ED and will explain most of the differences by the variables\n           in Hypotheses 1 and 2.\n        4. Conditional models of subjects who use key care-seeking phases, namely the Self, Lay\n           and Health Care Provider Phases, will identify unique predictors of time in each phase.\n        5. Significant interaction effects [model coefficient differences] will be found for\n           important risk variables and socially important gender, age and racial groups. For\n           example, African-Americans will show differences in model coefficients from\n           Non-African-Americans.\n      The proposed study utilizes a twice tested pilot ISCM survey instrument placed on two secure\n      dedicated web servers to collect patient care-seeking data. The target sample size for this\n      study is 2,314 patients who have experienced an ACS episode. Subjects will be recruited\n      using: 1] extensive marketing of the study URL on websites of interest to cardiac patients\n      and oriented toward cardiac health and ACS risks, such as, diabetes or hypertension; 2]\n      placement of study information on discussion boards and chat rooms with a cardiac health\n      focus; 3] emailing of a study flyer PDF for posting in public libraries, senior citizen\n      centers, African-American churches, county and municipal health clinics, and HMO web sites;\n      4] application of a viral marketing strategy; and 5] use of selected print media, for\n      example, AARP publications. Marketing of the study site URL will emphasize the recruitment\n      of women, the elderly and minorities. In the data collection phase of the study, the\n      proportions of myocardial infarction and angina pectoris subjects falling into each cell of\n      the cross classification of age, sex and race will be derived from NHANES 1999-2000 and\n      2001-2002 studies. These estimates of the population proportions in these cells will be used\n      to determine quotas for each of the cells in an attempt to ensure all risk groups are\n      adequately represented. We will over sample African-Americans. Statistical models will be\n      used to estimate the effects of variables that characterize the decision process on the time\n      delay until ED arrival. Time required to move from one phase of the decision process to the\n      next will also be modeled, as will the different paths chosen by the subjects. Models will\n      also include patient characteristics and other circumstantial and situational variables in\n      the decision process.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria: Acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina,\n        men & women, all races & ethnicities\n        Exclusion Criteria: age < 21 years\n", "cuis": "C0948089 C2986890 C2707008 C0947630 C1552616 C1706244 C0162340 C0947630 C0580931 C0677505 C2707008 C0948089 C0027051 C0947630 C0496675 C0038951 C0018787 C0027051 C1304680 C0580931 C0496675 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C0027051 C0518609 C0348000 C0038951 C0947630 C1551994 C0939261 C0679006 C0021228 C0027051 C1457887 C0947630 C0580931 C0441621 C3854058 C4049936 C0580931 C0677505 C2707008 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0162340 C0947630 C0580931 C0677505 C2707008 C0948089 C0185125 C0376495 C1947919 C2347934 C0185026 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C3853906 C1551994 C0580931 C0182953 C0348000 C0038951 C0580931 C0155626 C0340294 C0582803 C0264708 C0027051 C2063313 C1735640 C0340311 C0155668 C0428953 C0002965 C0340288 C0018787 C0011065 C1306577 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C0035124 C0016018 C0520997 C0076558 C0699886 C1290379 C0007222 C0455539 C0947630 C2825142 C1457887 C0580931 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0684240 C0007963 C0185115 C1555707 C3272565 C0518609 C0449416 C0947630 C3245479 C3834249 C4049609 C4049610 C4050368 C0679006 C2986890 C0496675 C1457887 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C3853906 C1551994 C0580931 C0182953 C0679006 C0423908 C0580931 C0580931 C1547298 C1547308 C1551396 C0580931 C1457887 C0580931 C0392148 C0424530 C0034869 C0580931 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C2700390 C0580931 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C0677505 C0580931 C2700390 C1551994 C0182953 C0018563 C3714557 C0220825 C1261322 C0086388 C1457887 C0013987 C0150600 C0740209 C1555587 C1707944 C0580931 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C0947630 C0392366 C0456984 C0180799 C0424927 C0013658 C0009253 C0700164 C1524073 C0849912 C0013987 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C0580931 C0679006 C0423908 C0580931 C0086388 C1441436 C1555587 C1457887 C0580931 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C0085632 C0580931 C0085632 C0580931 C3864998 C3853906 C0086388 C1441436 C1555587 C3858576 C0037420 C3853906 C0085632 C1552839 C3853906 C0085632 C0348000 C0392366 C0228018 C0038951 C0947630 C0017313 C3853617 C0019993 C0002423 C3245479 C0441621 C3812868 C3812869 C0034770 C0180011 C0947630 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0543488 C0018787 C0947630 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0018787 C1961028 C0557061 C0441587 C0035139 C1555302 C1533810 C0012725 C0018787 C0972401 C0947630 C3242430 C1561528 C1552597 C0947630 C0683877 C1554990 C0084136 C0680889 C0185125 C0376495 C1947919 C2347934 C0185026 C1512793 C0939710 C0034036 C1704324 C0271510 C0947630 C0947630 C3245479 C0034770 C0600644 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727 C2348362 C1168331 C0455406 C0340324 C1998297 C0340312 C0340325 C0428950 C2825159 C0002962 C0455530 C0085639 C0009253 C0444594 C0947630 C1552839 C0026348 C0441621 C0679006 C0423908 C0007952 C3245501 C3245502 C1619636 C0679006 C0423908 C3161035 C0022396 C0423864 C0679006 C0423908 C0243161 C0013893 C0155626 C1735640 C0582803 C0027051 C0340294 C0340311 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0340297 C0948089 C0002965 C0340288 C0243161 C0006086 C0221819 C0441421 C0243161 ", "concepts": "Acute Coronary Syndrome, Behavioral, Behavior, Study summary, summary understanding, study, care, behaviors, Behavior acute coronary syndromes, heart attacks, study medical care, survey, heart heart attack, attack, care medical care, Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic heart attack consideration, instrument, survey, study, self, complex b decisions, individuality heart attack, symptoms, study, care, sampled, donation, Donation care, behaviors, Behavior description, prescription, prescription understanding, study, care, behaviors, Behavior acute coronary syndromes, applications, Reapplication, Application, Application, plication, testing, q testing, t testing model, self, care, regulator instrument, survey, care AMI -
