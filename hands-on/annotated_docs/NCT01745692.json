{"text": "TITLE:\n      Pragmatic Ischaemic Stroke Thrombectomy Evaluation\nSUMMARY:\n      Ischaemic strokes (those caused by blockage in an artery in the brain caused by a blood\n      clot) can be treated with very early use of clot-busting (thrombolytic) drugs to attempt to\n      restore the blood supply and limit the damage, resulting in an increased proportion of\n      people making a recovery to independence after stroke. However, drug treatment only succeed\n      in restoring blood flow in a minority of people with clots in the larger arteries (10-25%\n      depending on the size of the blood vessel) and these people also have the most severe\n      strokes and highest risk of death or dependence as a result of the stroke. Current best\n      treatment is therefore least effective in the group with the most severe strokes. Devices\n      that can be fed through the blood vessels to either remove or break up the blood clot in the\n      brain vessels can open this type of large artery blockage. However, using these devices is a\n      highly skilled procedure and it takes some time both to set up the necessary facilities\n      (including anaesthetic, nurses and medical support) and to reach the blockage. The extra\n      time that is required to use these devices may mean that brain tissue is already\n      irreversibly damaged. If so, then an individual patient cannot benefit and indeed may be\n      harmed by opening the artery. There are no completed clinical trials comparing the outcome\n      in people treated with standard stroke treatment and those treated with devices. PISTE is a\n      randomised, controlled trial to test whether additional mechanical thrombectomy device\n      treatment improves functional outcome in patients with large artery occlusion who are given\n      IV thrombolytic drug treatment as standard care.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Clinical diagnosis of supratentorial acute ischaemic stroke\n          -  Male or nonpregnant female \u226518 years of age\n          -  Clinically significant neurological deficit and NIHSS score \u22656.\n          -  Eligible for IV rtPA according to standard guidelines and able to be commenced on IV\n             treatment <4.5h after symptom onset.\n          -  Enrolment, randomisation and procedure commencement (groin puncture) possible within\n             90 minutes of the start of IV rtPA treatment (groin puncture maximum 5.5h after\n             stroke onset).\n          -  Occlusion of the main middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk, MCA bifurcation or\n             intracranial internal carotid artery(carotidT, M1 or single proximal M2 branch)\n             demonstrated on CTA, MRA, or DSA.\n          -  Interventional device delivery (guide catheter placed beyond aortic arch and angio\n             obtained) can be achieved within 6 hours of onset of the stroke.\n          -  Consent of patient or representative.\n          -  Independent prior to the stroke (estimated mRS 02)\n          -  Expected to be able to be followed up at 3 months\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  CT evidence of intracranial haemorrhage, or evidence of extensive established\n             hypodensity on CT.\n          -  Clinical history suggestive of subarachnoid haemorrhage even if CT normal.\n          -  Known vascular access contraindications e.g. femoral bypass surgery, tight\n             ipsilateral carotid stenosis, unsuitable proximal vascular anatomy likely to render\n             endovascular catheterisation difficult or impossible.\n          -  Extracranial ICA occlusion or basilar artery occlusion\n          -  Alternative intracranial pathology potentially responsible for the new symptoms\n          -  Medical comorbidities which would preclude safe cerebral vessel catheterisation or\n             which are expected to limit life expectancy to <3 months (eg severe cardiac, renal or\n             hepatic failure, significant coagulopathy, metastatic malignancy)\n          -  Known allergy to radiological contrast\n", "cuis": "C0162578 C0220825 C1261322 C0038454 C0022116 C1552616 C1706244 C2237319
