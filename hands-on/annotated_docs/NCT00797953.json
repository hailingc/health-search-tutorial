{"text": "TITLE:\n      Phase II Multi-Center Study of T89 to Treat Chronic Stable Angina\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the anti-angina effect and dose response of T89, a\n      2-herb botanical drug product, in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris in the United\n      States.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      T89 is a modernized and industrialized version of a traditional Chinese herbal medicine. T89\n      was approved for marketing as a drug, for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris\n      due to coronary heart disease, by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of China in\n      1993. There were more than 2 billion doses have been prescribed or used, in about 10,000,000\n      subjects, in short or long-term administration worldwide.\n      The product is also marketed, as a drug, in Russia, South Korea, Mongolia, Singapore,\n      Vietnam, and South Africa. The current study is to determine the anti-angina effect and dose\n      response of T89 in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris in the United States.\n      T89 consists of Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae, RSM) and Sanqi (Radix Notoginseng, RN)\n      as active constitutes, and using Borneol as transporting enhancer.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          1.

Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, not be breast\n             feeding and established on a method of contraception that in the investigator's\n             opinion is acceptable. Females must agree to remain on their established method of\n             contraception through their participation in the study.\n          3. Evidence of coronary artery disease that consists of a well-documented medical\n             history (over 3 months prior to the enrollment) of myocardial infarction or\n             significant coronary artery disease with noninvasive or angiographic confirmation.\n          4.

All anti-angina regimen (except short-acting nitroglycerin, and one beta-blocker or\n             calcium channel blocker), warfarin or other oral anticoagulants which were used prior\n             to this initial visit can be discontinued.\n          8.

Clinically significant arrhythmias or atrioventricular conduction block greater than\n             first degree.\n          4. Clinically significant co-morbidities, including hepatic or renal dysfunction,\n             pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of cerebral\n             hemorrhage, or seizure disorders that required anticonvulsant medication.\n          5.
