{"text": "TITLE:\n      A Chinese Randomized Crossover Study of Erlotinib Versus Docetaxel/Cisplatin in Previously Untreated Stage IIIB/IV Lung Adenocarcinoma With EGFR Mutations\nSUMMARY:\n      Objective: the objective of this study in china is to clarify, whether the overall survival\n      is different between previously untreated stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR\n      mutations receiving first-line erlotinib plus second-line docetaxel/cisplatin and those\n      receiving first-line docetaxel/cisplatin plus second-line erlotinib .\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Male and female patients aged over 18 years\n          -  Histologically proven lung adenocarcinoma\n          -  clinical stage IIIB/IV\n          -  ECOG performance status 0-2\n          -  Had no prior anticancer agent, radiation or surgical therapy for lung adenocarcinoma\n          -  At least one measurable lesion (according to RECIST)\n          -  Provision of written informed consent\n          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  History of malignant disease.\n          -  Evidence of clinically active interstitial lung diseases (patients with chronic,\n             stable, radiographic changes who are asymptomatic need not be excluded)\n          -  Expected life expectancy less than 2 months\n          -  As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic\n             disease (e.g. unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal\n             disease)\n          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) \u2265 2.5 x\n             ULN if no demonstrable liver metastases (or >5 x in presence of liver metastases)\n          -  Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes\n             it undesirable for the subject to participate in the study\n          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding women (women of child\u00acbearing potential). Women of\n             childbearing potential must practice acceptable methods of birth control to prevent\n             pregnancy.\n", "cuis": "C0152013 C1708045 C1332137 C1335096 C0001418 C1135135 C0246415 C0008838 C0947630 C1300072 C3897779 C0332155 C1552616 C1706244 C0018017 C2979883 C2239270 C0947630 C2065082 C0152013 C0001418 C0332155 C1300072 C1135135 C0246415 C0008838 C0671450 C0246415 C0008838 C0671450 C1135135 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0152013 C0001418 C0700164 C1300072 C3272565 C1520224 C1632812 C1518965 C1828127 C2242580 C2747818 C0152013 C0001418 C0087111 C0033972 C1522449 C1524020 C1963223 C0543467 C0587668 C0221198 C0772294 C0009797 C0077935 C0243161 C0442867 C0260515 C0262926 C2004062 C0206062 C2215135 C0340097 C0746105 C1320102 C0231221 C0343751 C1552867 C1306645 C0043299 C1962945 C1517001 C1561542 C1306232 C0443343 C0012634 C0018609 C0018787 C0205054 C0022646 C0042497 C0087153 C2266627 C1546767 C0012634 C0018609 C0201899 C0428339 C2709181 C0855624 C0151904 C0855623 C2229595 C1654951 C0855622 C0201836 C0855620 C0494165 C0392148 C0012634 C0587081 C3272565 C0947630 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C2148613 C3714845 C0006141 C2222792 C0700589 C2703065 C0237607 C3245512 C0025663 C0025664 C2222792 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 ", "concepts": "Lung Adenocarcinoma, Fetal Lung Adenocarcinoma, Acinar Lung Adenocarcinoma, Occult Lung Adenocarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma, Erlotinib, Docetaxel, Cisplatin, Study, Stage, Randomiz, untreated summary, summary Objective, Objective, objective, study, coveralls lung adenocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma, untreated, stage erlotinib, docetaxel, cisplatin, ME cisplatin docetaxel, cisplatin, ME cisplatin, erlotinib criteria, Eligibility Criteria lung adenocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma, proven stage, Clinical ECOG performance status, ECOG performance status grade, performance status, ECOG performance status finding, ECOG performance status worsened, ECOG performance status improved lung adenocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma, therapy, Cotherapy, Radiation, Radiation, Radiation, Surgical, Surgical lesion, Alesion informed consent form, urovision Criteria malignant disease, FH: Malignant disease, History, History ILD - Interstitial lung disease, acute interstitial lung disease, Interstitial lung disease NEC, Chronic interstitial lung disease, Factive asymptomatic, asymptomatic HIV, exclude, radiographs, radiography, radiography Expected, month severed unstable, disease, h disease, cardiac, hepatic, renal, respirators, respirator, respirator, Respiratory disease, h disease Aspartate aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase level, Aspartate aminotransferase.total, Aspartate aminotransferase normal, Aspartate aminotransferase increased, Aspartate aminotransferase abnormal, serum aspartate aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferas test, Aspartate aminotransferase decreased, Alanine aminotransferase, Alanine aminotransferase normal liver metastases, presence disorder, laboratory findings, Clinical study pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
