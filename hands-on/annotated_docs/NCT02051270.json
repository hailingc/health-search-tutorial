{"text": "TITLE:\n      Cognitive Impairment and Balance in Elderly\nSUMMARY:\n      One important issue in older adults with cognitive problems is the higher risk of fall due\n      to decreased motor function and balance. The objective of this study is to evaluate the\n      repercussions of mild cognitive impairment in balance in elderly.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Mild cognitive impairment is described as a transitional stage between normal ageing and\n      dementia, and reflects the clinical situation where a person has memory complaints and\n      objective evidence of cognitive impairment but no evidence of dementia. Mild cognitive is\n      important in older people and it is also important to evaluate its repercussion in balance.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Nursing home residents.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Surgery on lower limbs.\n          -  Traumatic damage on lower limbs.\n          -  Severe cognitive impairment in order not to complete the assessment.\n", "cuis": "C0009241 C0338656 C1270972 C3639421 C0014653 C0179199 C0560184 C1588717 C1552616 C1706244 C0085639 C3842628 C3843761 C1547928 C1555709 C1948032 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0031843 C1705273 C0014653 C2174421 C0179199 C0542274 C1397014 C3497399 C0947630 C0220825 C0032827 C0162119 C0239787 C0520831 C0520870 C0728725 C1295611 C1295666 C1295669 C1270972 C0338656 C0014653 C2174421 C0179199 C0542274 C1397014 C3497399 C0030987 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C1270972 C0338656 C1719378 C1553386 C0001811 C1300072 C0277786 C0424577 C0011265 C0497327 C0558058 C0025260 C0700327 C3272565 C0338656 C1270972 C3554639 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0011265 C0497327 C1513302 C1547225 C0014653 C2174421 C0179199 C0542274 C1397014 C3497399 C0030987 C1555709 C1948032 C0220825 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0006147 C0243161 C0023216 C0153665 C1269079 C0543467 C1705196 C3842534 C3842535 C3842536 C0023216 C0153665 C1269079 C0010957 C3554639 C0338656 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C1522411 C3244315 C1815293 ", "concepts": "Cognitive Impairments, Cognitive Impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairments, UPD2-Cognitive Impairment, Balance, Balances, Balance, Balancer summary, summary fall, Cognitive problems, At higher risk, Tissue, folder, Folder Objective, objective, Objective, function, Function, balance, balance, balances, balances, Imbalance, Rebalance, study, Evaluate, K+ decreased, Hb decreased, GH decreased, VC decreased, CI decreased, pH decreased, LH decreased, T4 decreased, T3 decreased mild cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment, balance, balance, balances, balances, Imbalance, Rebalance, percussions description, prescription, prescription Mild cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment, Mild cognitive impairemt, normal, ageing, stage complaints, No complaints, dementia, dementia, reflects, memory, memory, Clinical cognitive impairment, Mild cognitive impairment, Severe cognitive impairment, Objective, objective, Objective, dementia, dementia, Mild, Mild balance, balance, balances, balances, Imbalance, Rebalance, percussion, folder, Folder, Evaluate criteria, Eligibility Criteria Nursing Criteria lower limb, Lower limb, Lower limb, Surgery, Surgery, Surgery 3, Surgery 2, Surgery 1 lower limb, Lower limb, Lower limb, damage Severe cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment, Assessment, assessments, Assessment, Assessment, IQ assessment, Border, orders, Complete "}
