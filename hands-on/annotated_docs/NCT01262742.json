{"text": "TITLE:\n      Carbetocin at Elective Cesarean Delivery\nSUMMARY:\n      Post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal death worldwide. Oxytocin is the\n      most commonly uterotonic drug used to prevent and treat PPH in North America, however, there\n      are some limitations to its use. Oxytocin has a very short duration of action, which\n      requires a continuous infusion to achieve sustained uterotonic activity. The Society of\n      Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) has recently recommended a single 100mcg\n      dose of carbetocin at elective Cesarean delivery to promote uterine contraction and prevent\n      post partum hemorrhage (PPH), in lieu of the more traditional oxytocin regimens. Carbetocin\n      lasts 4 to 7 times longer than oxytocin, with a similar side effect profile and apparent\n      greater efficacy rate. However, a dose response to determine the minimum effective dose of\n      carbetocin has not yet been published.\n      We hypothesize that a dose-response study will establish the minimum dose of carbetocin\n      required to produce appropriate contractility in 95% of the women (ED95) undergoing elective\n      cesarean delivery.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC)recently recommended a 100mcg\n      intravenous bolus dose of carbetocin following Cesarean delivery. However, a dose response\n      study to determine the minimum effective dose of carbetocin has not yet been published.\n      Studies thus far show that carbetocin may be just as effective as oxytocin in promoting\n      uterine contraction, with a similar side effects profile. In addition, patients receiving\n      carbetocin may experience less blood loss, and require less additional uterotonics when\n      compared with oxytocin.\n      The results of this study will define the minimum required dose of carbetocin for uterine\n      contraction, thus minimizing unnecessary side effects, improving quality and safety of\n      patient care. It may also contribute in establishing carbetocin as a substitute to oxytocin\n      for elective cesarean section at our institution as well as others.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  All patients planned for elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia;\n          -  All patients who gave written informed consent to participate in this study.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  All patients who refuse to give written informed consent.\n          -  All patients who claim allergy or hypersensitivity to carbetocin or oxytocin.\n          -  All patients with conditions that predispose to uterine atony and postpartum\n             hemorrhage such as placenta previa, multiple gestation, preeclampsia, eclampsia,\n             macrosomia, polyhydramnios, uterine fibroids, previous history of uterine atony and\n             postpartum bleeding, or bleeding diathesis.\n          -  All patients with hepatic, renal, and vascular disease,\n          -  All patients requiring general anesthesia prior to the administration of the study\n             drug.\n", "cuis": "C0473296 C0054670 C1552616 C1706244 C0032797 C1858460
