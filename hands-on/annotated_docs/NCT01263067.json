{"text": "TITLE:\n      Lifespan Integration for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder From an Auto Accident\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if lifespan integration (LI) therapy reduces\n      posttraumatic stress symptoms following a motor vehicle accident (MVA) trauma\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Studies estimate a substantial proportion of MVA survivors, ranging from 9.4% to 59.9%, will\n      develop PTSD following an accident (Blanchard & Hickling, 2004). Based on conservative\n      estimates, past research, indicates that MVA-related PTSD may affect 2.5 to 7 million\n      persons in the United States (Blanchard & Hickling). Furthermore, two seminal\n      epidemiological studies (Kessler et al., 1995; Norris, 1992) that focused on causes of adult\n      PTSD identified MVAs as the most frequent trauma resulting in PTSD. For these reasons,\n      MVA-resultant PTSD represents a significant public health problem that needs not only to be\n      thoroughly understood, but addressed with successful mental health treatment options (Beck &\n      Coffey, 2007; Blanchard & Hickling, 1997, 2004; Bryant et al., 1998; Taylor et al., 1999;\n      Taylor et al., 2001). Although there is empirical literature on the treatment of PTSD\n      following an MVA, additional efficacious and rigorously conducted studies with statistical\n      underpinnings are required to determine the results that can be expected from alternative\n      models of care (Beck & Coffey; Blanchard & Hickling, 1997, 2004).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Involved in or witnessed a car accident at least 6 months ago.\n          -  PTSD or distress or impairment in important areas of functioning following the car\n             accident\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  moderate or severe head injury\n          -  current mental health treatment for the MVA-related problem\n          -  severe chronic pre-injury mental health problems\n", "cuis": "C0038436 C0038441 C0000924 C2046386 C1441488 C1552616 C1706244 C0087111 C0033972 C0947630 C0220825 C0000932 C2063147 C1290896 C0521991 C3263723 C3714660 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0000924 C2046386 C0234201 C2363670 C0001721 C2237113 C0233492 C0445356 C0234201 C0947630 C3263723 C3714660 C1550043 C0600091 C2594846 C2239238 C3244304 C0699943 C1553687 C0033213 C2081614 C0184647 C1444372 C1444371 C1444373 C0683525 C0376649 C0234201 C0023866 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0947630 C3245501 C3245502 C1619636 C4055646 C1517001 C0580931 C3853906 C0234201 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1579887 C1561542 C1550486 C0684336 C3845945 C2598156 C0231303 C3887804 C0700361 C0000924 C2046386 C0243161 C0018674 C1306232 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C0184647 C1444372 C1444371 C1444373 C0033213 C2081614 C0233492 C0445356 C0025353 C0029162 C0025352 C3263723 C0033213 C2081614 C1306232 ", "concepts": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Traumatic Stress Disorder, Accidents, accident, Auto summary, summary therapy, Cotherapy, study, Evaluate motor vehicle accident, nonmotor vehicle accident, motor vehicle accident victim, stress symptoms, trauma, trauma description, prescription, prescription accidents, accident, Tickling, developer affect, affect, elated, Unrelated Tickling studies trauma, trauma, Identified, identifier, Ab identified public health, public health, Public health, public healthcare, problem, problem: mental health treatment, Teach mental health treatment, Assess mental health treatment, Manage mental health treatment, options, addresses Tickling literature, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment studies required, required, Required, Unexpected, Expected care, model, Tickling criteria, Eligibility Criteria car accident, month, witness impairment, No impairment, Impairments, distress, distressed, Distress accidents, accident Criteria head injury, severed, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate mental health treatment, Teach mental health treatment, Assess mental health treatment, Manage mental health treatment, problem, problem:, elated, Unrelated mental health, dental health, mental heal, injury, problem, problem:, severed "}
