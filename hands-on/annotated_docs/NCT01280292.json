{"text": "TITLE:\n      Central Hypothyroidism, a Novel Laboratory Measurement\nSUMMARY:\n      Medical management of central hypothyroidism is controversial due to lack of reference for\n      evaluation of pituitary negative feedback. Therefore, titration of medical treatment is\n      based on T4 levels, measured with variable laboratory methods. Patients who have central\n      hypothyroidism usually have concomitant deficiencies in other pituitary hormones for which\n      they need replacement therapy such as steroids, testosterone and growth hormone. This\n      combined hormone deficiency makes clinical and laboratory evaluation challenging among these\n      patients. Symptomatically, central hypothyroidism is relatively mild and lack non-specific\n      and it might be overlooked due to other hormonal deficiencies. Replacement therapy for\n      central hypothyroidism is titrated by arbitrary target free T4 levels of above 50th\n      percentile of normal. The goal of our study is to compare the standard results from well\n      known measure methods to a new method for measuring Ft4 using Liquid chromatography - tandem\n      mass spectrometry.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Clinical evidence of central hypothyroidism: status post pituitary surgery and/or\n             radiotherapy plus laboratory documentation of central hypothyroidism, with or without\n             concurrent hormonal deficiencies in other axes, such as ACTH, LH, FSH\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Primary hypothyroidism\n", "cuis": "C0271801 C3831153 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C3843236 C3843237 C3843238 C3843239 C1552616 C1706244 C0271801 C0376636 C1514811 C1561577 C0199168 C1561579 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0032005 C0032002 C0162621 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1513916 C2911691 C0449309 C0202231 C0505385 C0446414 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0020676 C0455486 C0032005 C0032002 C0162538 C0162539 C0279033 C1304648 C0206074 C0598391 C0037663 C0169964 C0202056 C0039601 C0202227 C0523912 C0027368 C1295654 C0599750 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C3272565 C0271801 C1552740 C0279033 C2015795 C0162538 C0162539 C0271801 C0202225 C0201956 C0376259 C1553386 C0947630 C0018017 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0008565 C0008556 C0373580 C0025663 C0025664 C0075804 C1578513 C3845898 C0037813 C0596495 C0183396 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0271801 C0032005 C0032002 C3272565 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0271801 C0175636 C0920316 C0034619 C1384668 C1522449 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C0162538 C0162539 C0243161 C0700502 C3714618 ", "concepts": "Central Hypothyroidism, Central Hyperthyroidism, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory, Measurement 4, Measurement 3, Measurement 2, Measurement 1 summary, summary central hypothyroidism, management, reference, Reference, Medical, Medical Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, Pituitary, Pituitary, titration, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, Negative, Feedback laboratory methods, T4 level, T4 level, c4 levels, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient hypothyroidism, H/O: hypothyroidism, Pituitary, Pituitary, iga deficiencies, igg deficiencies replacement therapy, Gene replacement therapy, renal replacement therapy, enzyme replacement therapy, growth hormones, Growth hormone, Growth hormone, testosterones, Testosterone, Testosterone, Nortestosterone, Low testosterone hormone deficiency, Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory, Clinical central hypothyroidism, specific Replacement therapy, other hormones, iga deficiencies, igg deficiencies central hypothyroidism, free T4, citrated, citrated normal, study, goal, standards, Standard, Standard Liquid chromatography, Gas-liquid chromatography, Gas/liquid chromatography, method, methods, tandem, new, Uknown mass spectrometry, ESI mass spectrometry, mass spectrometer criteria, Eligibility Criteria central hypothyroidism, Pituitary, Pituitary, Clinical, surgery, surgery, surgery: central hypothyroidism, Documentation, documentations, radiotherapy, radiotherapy, radiotherapy, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory iga deficiencies, igg deficiencies Criteria Primary hypothyroidism, Primary hyperthyroidism "}
