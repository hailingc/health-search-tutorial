{"text": "TITLE:\n      Metformin Reduces Left Ventricular Mass in Patients With Ischemic Heart Disease\nSUMMARY:\n      Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the world. Most of the attention\n      in treating ischemic heart disease (IHD) is understandably directed toward treating coronary\n      artery disease. However there are other treatable culprits in these patients.\n      Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is widespread in IHD patients, even in the absence of\n      hypertension. It is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. In\n      one study, the presence of LVH was a stronger predictor of mortality than either multivessel\n      cor-onary disease or impaired LV function.\n      Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent with a history of successful use in type 2 diabetes.\n      In the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study), metformin was associated with a\n      39% lower risk of myocardial infarction compared with conventional therapy. Metformin also\n      offered dual benefits of improving vascular function and lessening ischemia in nondiabetic\n      patients.\n      Hence, the main aim of this study was to assess whether metformin could regress LVM in\n      patients with IHD. The secondary aim was to assess the effect of metformin on LV volumes and\n      endothelial function in this patient group.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  They had to have normal glucose tolerance.\n          -  They had to have either angiographically documented coronary artery disease or a\n             previous history of myocardial infarction.\n          -  They were required to have an office BP < 130/80 mm Hg\n          -  The presence of LVH on echocardiography (American Society of Echocardiography\n             criteria LVM index [LVMI] > 115 g/m2 for men and > 95 g/m2 for women).\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  They were currently prescribed metformin.\n          -  They had renal and liver dysfunction, heart failure, or malignancy, or were unable to\n             give informed consent.\n          -  Patients with contraindications to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (pacemakers,\n             claustrophobia) were also excluded, as were pregnant or lactating women.\n", "cuis": "C0151744 C0455825 C0025598 C1614658 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0007222 C0455404 C0348668 C0455346 C0455539 C0264656 C1290379 C0042373 C0007465 C4050444 C0004268 C0424101 C3245511 C0151744 C1313980 C0010054 C1510446 C0264694 C0018787 C0852949 C0149721 C3484363 C0232306 C0344398 C0340279 C3476091 C0162770 C0281788 C1845019 C0151744 C0424530 C1320716 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0392148 C0947630 C0149721 C0031843 C1705273 C0012634 C0018609 C0020616 C0011860 C1320657 C0025598 C1614658 C0262926 C2004062 C0025598 C0011847 C0011849 C0011860 C0947630 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727 C2348362 C1168331 C0455406 C0340324 C1998297 C0340312 C0340325 C0428950 C2825159 C2945704 C0025598 C1614658 C0005847 C0031843 C1705273 C0022116 C0025598 C0947630 C0027627 C0025598 C0151744 C0031843 C1705273 C1552839 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0178665 C0017741 C0029161 C0430123 C1553386 C0010054 C1956346 C0010068 C1301725 C1609436 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727 C2348362 C1168331 C0455406 C0340324 C1998297 C0340312 C0340325 C0428950 C2825159 C0262926 C2004062 C3245501 C3245502 C1619636 C0013516 C0183129 C0203378 C0013524 C0203379 C0221533 C0412564 C2243117 C0392148 C0149721 C0243161 C0918012 C0770655 C0243161 C0278329 C0025598 C0086565 C0018801 C0018802 C0006826 C1306459 C3842363 C1299582 C0022646 C0009797 C0810633 C0030163 C0231881 C0018787 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0008909 C0549206 C1552867 C2828358 C3668831 ", "concepts": "Ischemic Heart Disease, Left Ventricular Mass, Metformin, Metforming, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary CVD -
