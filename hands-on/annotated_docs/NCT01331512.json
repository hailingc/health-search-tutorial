{"text": "TITLE:\n      The InChianti Follow-Up Study\nSUMMARY:\n      Background:\n      - Older persons are often referred to physicians because of mobility difficulties that grow\n      worse as they age. To better understand the reasons for mobility difficulties in older\n      persons, researchers conducted a population-based study of individuals living in the Chianti\n      geographic area of Tuscany, Italy. Researchers are now interested in conducting a follow-up\n      study on the original participants to assess the effects of aging on their mobility.\n      Objectives:\n      - To conduct a follow-up study on the participants in the mobility study of older persons in\n      the Greve in Chianti and Bagno a Ripoli areas near Florence, Italy.\n      Eligibility:\n      - Original participants in the InChianti Mobility Study.\n      Design:\n        -  The InChianti Follow-up Study will repeat most elements of the baseline evaluation from\n           the original study. Participants will be seen on the 3-year anniversary of their\n           baseline study assessment.\n        -  Participants will have a home interview with questions about their physical and mental\n           health, family history, daily activities, and living conditions related to their\n           continued mobility.\n        -  Participants will provide blood and urine samples, and will have tests of heart and\n           motor nerve function and imaging studies of bones and the circulatory system.\n        -  Participants will also have a functional evaluation of their motor skills, including\n           walking tests, range of motion tests, and grip strength.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      In the past decade epidemiologic and clinical studies have described the prevalence and\n      incidence of disability and have elucidated demographic characteristics, health behaviors,\n      diseases, and physiologic impairments that are associated with increased risk of developing\n      disability in old age. Mobility disability has emerged as a critical aspect of functioning.\n      Mobility, defined as the ability to move independently from one point to another, is a\n      critical part of maintaining independence and an essential attribute of quality of life. In\n      those age 85 years and older, nearly 60 percent of women and 40 percent of men have\n      difficulty walking two to three blocks. Older people who are mobile are more likely to\n      remain in the community, have lower rates of subsequent morbidity and mortality, and have\n      higher quality of life. Recent work in biomechanics, clinical geriatrics, epidemiology, and\n      clinical trials has helped to improve our understanding of the decline in walking ability in\n      old age and the influence of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. However, a great deal\n      is still not understood about how older persons progressively lose the ability to ambulate.\n      The InChianti Study has the potential to make major new advances in our knowledge of\n      progressive decline in ambulation in older persons.\n      A great deal of information is available from the baseline evaluation in this study and the\n      crosssectional analyses that can be done with these data will be very valuable. There are,\n      however, limitations in what we can learn from cross-sectional data. The baseline data\n      revealed many relationships between factors that were studied and disability, but there may\n      be circularity in these relationships that cannot be sorted out if we only have\n      cross-sectional data available. For example, abnormalities in certain biomarkers may be a\n      cause of disability or may be caused by disability. Only by doing longitudinal analyses that\n      begin with non-disabled persons can the temporal sequence be determined. Cross-sectional\n      analyses only permit the study of factors that are currently related to disability while\n      longitudinal analyses allow for the identification of subclinical markers of risk that\n      predict future disability onset. There is therefore much to be gained by performing a\n      follow-up evaluation of the cohort to obtain longitudinal data.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n        Age 65 years and older\n        Must reside in Greve in Chianti or Bagno A Ripoli, Italy\n        Subjects with modertative cognitive problems will be included as long as the consent can\n        be read and signed by by a first-degree relative of the participant or, in absence of\n        first-degree relative, another relative living with or close to the participant\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n        Children\n", "cuis": "C1704685 C0947630 C1552616 C1706244 C1299586 C0425245 C0231441 C2698482 C1550488 C1554180 C1299586 C0162340 C0425245 C0231441 C2698482 C1457868 C1555709 C1948032 C0947630 C0543488 C2183819 C1553382 C2697660 C0425245 C0231441 C2698482 C0947630 C0001811 C0034634 C0018017 C2979883 C0425245 C0231441 C2698482 C0947630 C1555709 C1948032 C0013893 C0425245 C2698482 C0947630 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C1719822 C0947630 C0728774 C0947630 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C0947630 C0728774 C0935630 C0229992 C0028977 C0031809 C1509143 C3272557 C0241889 C0332123 C1397163 C1397164 C2584882 C2239122 C2004436 C0012634 C0233492 C0445356 C0425245 C0231441 C2698482 C1444662 C0005768 C0229664 C0042036 C0591833 C0392366 C3850116 C0018787 C1555587 C1881134 C0501384 C0031843 C1705273 C0262950 C0005775 C0278372 C0026612 C0080078 C0150220 C2607871 C0576002 C2055622 C0576094 C1319209 C0429271 C2346415 C2368355 C0392366 C3850116 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0947630 C0699910 C3272565 C0231170 C0677505 C0022396 C0423864 C0012634 C0684336 C2598156 C0031843 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C0231170 C0425245 C2698482 C0040399 C1547298 C1547308 C1551396 C0425245 C2698482 C1299583 C1279748 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C1547298 C1547308 C1551396 C1555709 C1948032 C0311394 C0028778 C2229232 C0220880 C0729829 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C0699910 C3272565 C1096775 C0162340 C2346415 C2368355 C0021918 C0373657 C1555709 C1948032 C4036205 C0376554 C4036285 C0947630 C1578513 C2222792 C0945826 C3839460 C1555709 C1948032 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0947630 C3242430 C1561528 C0728774 C3245479 C1516986 C1328018 C0179038 C0023185 C3245479 C1552858 C0728774 C0231170 C0237886 C0005516 C3245479 C3809765 C0015393 C0151583 C0151611 C0476403 C0522214 C1832603 C2183966 C2674738 C1552858 C0087130 C0231170 C1720467 C0179038 C3853789 C1547787 C1610719 C2936910 C0935456 C0039487 C1552858 C0231170 C0947630 C0233492 C0445356 C0179038 C0020792 C3516629 C0150323 C0277767 C0557971 C0005516 C1254223 C0179038 C0231170 C1328018 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C3245479 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1114365 C1555709 C1948032 C3842628 C1561610 C2090600 C0542560 C1705179 C0424530 C3172260 C0542560 C3172260 C0243161 ", "concepts": "Follow-Up, Study summary, summary difficulties, mobility, Immobility, nobility, referrer, Deferred difficulties, understand, mobility, Immobility, nobility, worse, folder, Folder study interested, disinterested, Ideographic, Ideographic mobility, Immobility, nobility, study, aging, raging Objective, Objective mobility, Immobility, nobility, study, folder, Folder Eligibility Mobility, nobility, Study Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, Follow, Study, Vaseline study Assessment, assessments, Assessment, Assessment, IQ assessment, study, Vaseline interview, mental, Omental, Physical, Physical, Physical family history, No family history, family history;
