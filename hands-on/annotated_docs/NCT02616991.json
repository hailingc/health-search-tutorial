{"text": "TITLE:\n      Computed Tomography CT Venography During Postpartum Venous Thromboembolism\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to determine whether systematically performing computed\n      tomography (CT) venography (i.e a CT acquisition of the pelvis and of the lower limbs,\n      during the venous phase of opacification) in addition to thoracic CT angiography in women\n      with suspected postpartum pulmonary embolism (PE) results in a gain in venous\n      thromboembolism detection rate.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a leading cause of maternal death during postpartum in\n      developed countries; Thoracic computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the first-line\n      diagnostic test for PE suspicion, but has a 20 to 35% rate of inconclusiveness during\n      pregnancy and postpartum, 2 to 3 times higher than that of the general population. CT\n      venography (CTV) consists in a delayed CT acquisition of the abdomen, pelvis and lower\n      limbs, 3 minutes after starting contrast administration. It can be used for detecting deep\n      venous thrombosis (DVT), the source of emboli in most PEs. The investigators hypothesized\n      most postpartum PEs are due to pelvic vein thrombosis and that detecting such pelvic DVT by\n      performing systematic CTV could increase the overall venous thromboembolism (VTE) detection.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Women with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) during the first 6 weeks\n             postpartum, without any sign of severe PE (shock, hypotension), referred for CT\n             angiography\n          -  Absence of contraindication to iodinated contrast medium injection\n          -  Age > 18 years\n          -  Health insurance\n          -  Possibility to have 3-month follow-up\n          -  Obtention of written informed consent (ability to give consent)\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Anticoagulation at therapeutic dosage for another reason than the suspicion of PE\n          -  New pregnancy (\u03b2HCG positive before CT angiography)\n          -  Contrast medium extravasation during injection\n          -  CTA or CTV not performed according to the study requirements\n", "cuis": "C1861172 C0040405 C2717955 C0860888 C1956110 C0031545 C0205917 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C1441526 C0023216 C0153665 C1269079 C0040395 C0040405 C0034579 C0031545 C0205917 C1690005 C2317140 C0030797 C1536105 C0002978 C1690968 C0817096 C0729233 C1562898 C0034065 C0585968 C0856722 C2882221 C0340537 C0349752 C0040038 C0455533 C1511790 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0034065 C0585968 C0340537 C0349752 C0856722 C1858460 C0721591 C0011065 C1306577 C0040405 C0412643 C2181323 C0008794 C0860888 C0002978 C1536105 C1690968 C0729233 C0817096 C2363670 C0086143 C1263440 C0242114 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0031545 C0205917 C1690005 C2317140 C0000726 C0230168 C0030797 C1533734 C0376495 C0199808 C0199810 C0725057 C1536282 C0001563 C0036589 C0150270 C3469597 C0015385 C0561942 C0886384 C0449900 C1507248 C0009924 C0042487 C0517555 C0149871 C0740384 C2728549 C0040038 C0449416 C0042487 C0587220 C0149871 C0030797 C0040038 C0455533 C1511790 C2065082 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0034065 C0585968 C0856722 C2882221 C0340537 C0349752 C0020649 C3163620 C0163170 C0036974 C1306232 C1550488 C1554180 C0002978 C1536105 C1690968 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C0021485 C1533685 C0444600 C0021493 C0424530 C1960405 C0361904 C1114365 C0021682 C3173817 C3173818 C0009797 C0243161 C2917212 C3537050 C0003281 C0242114 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C1536105 C0002978 C1690968 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C1514241 C0015376 C0021485 C1533685 C0444600 C0021493 C0009924 C0947630 C3248452 C0556050 ", "concepts": "Venous Thromboembolism, Xray Computed Tomography, 4D Computed Tomography, Spiral Computed Tomography, Volume Computed Tomography, Venography, Renography summary, summary study, Computed lower limb, Lower limb, Lower limb, Tomography, tomography, Pantomography, venography, Renography, MR venography, CT venography, pelvis CT angiography, angiography, US angiography, thoracics, Thoracic, IOL opacification Pulmonary embolism NOS, Hx pulmonary embolism, Chr pulmonary embolism, Acute pulmonary embolism, pulmonary fat embolism, pulmonary air embolism thromboembolism, H/O: thromboembolism, Detection description, prescription, prescription PE -
