{"text": "TITLE:\n      Causal Inference Research of Resistant Hypertension Treatment With Chinese Approach in a Cohort Study\nSUMMARY:\n      Background: Syndrome differentiation is one of the substantial characteristics in\n      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) but is still lack of scientific evidence. The inference\n      methods of causal relationship between treatment and clinical effect under real-world study\n      may help.\n      Objectives: This study aims to assess the efficacy of Phlegm and Stasis Syndrome\n      differentiation method in treating resistant hypertension and explore causal inference in\n      the real-world study.\n      Research design and methods: It is a multicenter, prospective, two-arm, cohort study\n      including 200 patients with resistant hypertension (doctors' diagnosis based on the American\n      Heart Association criteria 2008). Essential hypertension subjects, aged 18-70 years, blood\n      pressure > 140/90 mm Hg even used to be on 3 or more medications for a month and diagnosed\n      as Phlegm and Stasis Syndrome will be included. Thiazide diuretics and/or two more\n      antihypertensive agents for 8 weeks, Chinese herbs (for synchronic treating phlegm and blood\n      stasis) and nonpharmacological recommendations were initiated in the observational group and\n      the control group received the same interventions without Chinese herbs.\n      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes will be Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood\n      pressure reductions and changes in symptoms and signs. Cardiac event and death incident will\n      be the secondary outcomes. Possible side effects and adverse reactions arising from the\n      treatment like diarrhea will be recorded.\n      Discussion: This is a rigorous methodology pilot study and 200 participants is enough to\n      calculate sample size in later formal trial.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Essential hypertension subjects, aged 18-70 years, blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg even\n             used to be on 3 or more medications for a month and diagnosed as Phlegm and Stasis\n             Syndrome will be included.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients will be excluded for the following conditions: with secondary resistant\n             hypertension because of other disease like renal disease or pheochromocytoma;\n             included in other clinical trial in one month; pregnant or breast-feed or preparing\n             for pregnancy female; combined with disease like stroke, coronary atherosclerotic\n             heart disease, diabetes, chronic renal failure or mental disease.\n", "cuis": "C0020538 C1963138 C3248638 C0947663 C0085580 C0455405 C1696708 C3829824 C0679201 C1514892 C2827757 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0947630
