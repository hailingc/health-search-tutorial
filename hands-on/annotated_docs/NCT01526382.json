{"text": "TITLE:\n      Use of PiCCO System in Critically Ill Patients With Septic Shock and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\nSUMMARY:\n      PiCCO has been widely used in critical care settings for several decades. Together with\n      pulmonary artery catheter, it is regarded as the important tool for guiding fluid management\n      in patients with shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, its effects on\n      patients' outcome remain untested. The investigators study is a pilot study that is designed\n      to test whether the use of PiCCO will improve patients' outcome, as compared to those\n      without PiCCO monitoring.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      PiCCO comprises techniques of pulse contour analysis and transpulmonary thermodilution, and\n      can provide important information on hemodynamics and pulmonary functions. It has been\n      widely used in critical care settings for several decades. Together with pulmonary artery\n      catheter (PAC), it is regarded as the important tool for guiding fluid management in\n      patients with shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome. During last two decades, many\n      well designed clinical trials have been conducted to see whether the use of PAC would\n      benefit patient outcome. The result consistently showed that PAC added no benefit in terms\n      of mortality, ICU length of stay, organ failure free survival days, and the length of\n      mechanical ventilation. Since PiCCO is relatively new to PAC, and its effects on patients'\n      outcome remain untested. The investigators study is a pilot study that is designed to test\n      whether the use of PiCCO will improve patients' outcome, as compared to those without PiCCO\n      monitoring.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n        Patients were included if they were diagnosed with Shock, Acute respiratory distress\n        syndrome (ARDS), or both.\n        Shock was defined by the presence 4 criteria:\n          -  Heart rate of at least 90/min;\n          -  A respiratory rate of at least 20/min or a PaCO2 of 32mmHg or lower or the use of\n             mechanical ventilation;\n          -  The use of vasopressors to maintain a systolic blood pressure of at least 90mmHg\n             despite fluid resuscitation, low dose of dopamine (\u2264 5 \u03bcg/kg per minute), or\n             dobutamine;\n          -  at least 1 of 3 signs of hypoperfusion (urine output < 0.5mL/kg of body weight per\n             hour for 1 hour or more; neurologic dysfunction defined by confusion, psychosis, or a\n             Glasgow coma scale score of \u2264 6; plasma lactate higher than the upper limit of the\n             normal value).\n        Acute respiratory distress syndrome\uff1a\n          -  the presence of acute decrease in PaO2/FIO2 to 200mmHg or lower,\n          -  bilateral pulmonary infiltrates or a chest radiograph consistent with edema;\n          -  no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension; and requirement for positive\n             pressure ventilation.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients were moribund.\n          -  signed do-not-resuscitation odor.\n", "cuis": "C0035222 C0035220 C0852283 C0158940 C0010340 C0036983 C1947944 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0010337 C0179790 C1827218 C0007438 C0553741 C1272407 C0035220 C0035222 C2909981 C0158940 C0865851 C0036974 C0947630 C0392366 C0456984 C0150369 C1283169 C0026426 C0182230 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0039807 C0025664 C0034107 C0391850 C0002778 C0024109 C2707265 C0031843 C1555587 C3242430 C1561528 C0034052 C1269026 C0545747 C0226069 C0923925 C1269883 C0489875 C0003861 C0226054 C0923924 C1269884 C0503867 C0010337 C0553741 C1272407 C0085590 C1704454 C1546572 C0035220 C0035222 C2909981 C0158940 C0865851 C0036974 C1096775 C0776963 C0349410 C0199470 C2223989 C3836859 C0042497 C2223988 C2228926 C2223979 C1578513 C0947630 C0392366 C0456984 C0150369 C1283169 C0026426 C0182230 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0748355 C0264493 C1441456 C0476273 C0035222 C0264219 C0011900 C1408353 C0036974 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0039082 C0206064 C0796095 C0796110 C2936859 C2936904 C0035222 C0392148 C0243161 C0036974 C0018810 C0488794 C2041121 C2197023 C0488849 C0488855 C0231832 C0489258 C0231837 C0429743 C0436708 C1822070 C0199470 C2223989 C3836859 C0042497 C2223988 C2228926 C2223979 C0871470 C1306620 C0488055 C0277884 C0428883 C0488052 C1305849 C1319895 C0277882 C1277632 C2039694 C1282149 C1282150 C1282151 C1282174 C1319893 C2039700 C4071677 C0277883 C0428882 C1303018 C1840374 C2039699 C2133958 C0042397 C0721534 C0150238 C0013030 C0201989 C1550472 C0012963 C0442856 C0232856 C1287298 C2094175 C2188753 C0028961 C1305866 C0944911 C0751377 C0009676 C0683369 C1963086 C0033975 C0349204 C0017594 C1369880 C2239197 C0278164 C0278165 C0278166 C0278167 C0278168 C0278169 C0278170 C0278171 C0278172 C0278173 C0278174 C0278175 C0278176 C0376261 C1881354 C0032105 C1140618 C1553386 C0035222 C0035220 C1848829 C0748355 C0392148 C0332448 C1546677 C1306645 C0043299 C1962945 C1548003 C0024109 C2707265 C0817096 C0013604 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0018792 C0524422 C3272565 C1514241 C0035203 C2945579 C0460139 C0243161 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0424547 C1547299 C0035273 C2366754 C2587207 C3854420 C1561610 C2090600 ", "concepts": "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Type II Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Critically Ill, Septic Shock, Use, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary critical care pulmonary artery catheter, Pulmonary artery catheter care, pulmonary artery catheterization, fluids management, Fluid management respiratory distress syndrome of newborn, Adult respiratory distress syndrome, NOS, Respiratory distress syndrome, type I, Respiratory distress syndrome, type II, Adult respiratory distress syndrome NEC, shock study test, test monitoring, Monitoring, monitoring BP, monitoring ph description, prescription, prescription thermodilution, techniques, pulse, pulse, Analysis pulmonary, Pulmonary, function, provider, informational, Information pulmonary arteries, Pulmonary artery, artery pulmonary, left pulmonary artery, left pulmonary artery, Left pulmonary artery, pulmonary artery.main, pulmonary arteritis, Right pulmonary artery, Right pulmonary artery, Right pulmonary artery, Lobar pulmonary artery, critical care fluids management, Fluid management, Catheter, Catheter, Catheter respiratory distress syndrome of newborn, Adult respiratory distress syndrome, NOS, Respiratory distress syndrome, type I, Respiratory distress syndrome, type II, Adult respiratory distress syndrome NEC, shock clinical trials wadded organ failure Mechanical ventilation, NOS, mechanical ventilation rate, mechanical ventilation care, mechanical ventilators, mechanical ventilation volume, mechanical ventilation weaning, mode of mechanical ventilation, new study, test, test monitoring, Monitoring, monitoring BP, monitoring ph criteria, Eligibility Criteria Acute respiratory distress (finding), Acute respiratory distress, NEC, Acute respiratory distress culture, respiratory distress, Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Acute respiratory disease, diagnosed, Undiagnosed, Shock, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient syndrome, syndrome X, syndrome c, W syndrome, N syndrome, G syndrome, ards presence, criteria, Shock heart rates, Heart rate, heart rate, heart rate, Heart rate 1h, Heart rate 8h respiratory rates, Respiratory rate, low respiratory rate, Respiratory ratio, O/E -
