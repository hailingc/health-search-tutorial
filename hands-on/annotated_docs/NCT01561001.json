{"text": "TITLE:\n      IOP Fluctuations in Primary Open Angle Glaucoma Patients Before and After Deep Sclerectomy With Collagen Implant\nSUMMARY:\n      Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is associated with inadequate drainage of the aqueous\n      humor via the trabecular meshwork towards the systemic circulation. This may lead to an\n      increase in IOP and may damage the optic nerve. The purpose of glaucoma management is to\n      lower IOP in order to prevent progression of the optic neuropathy and subsequent visual\n      loss. Firstline treatment usually includes IOP-lowering drug therapy. However, if IOP\n      remains uncontrolled and/or the optic nerve damage progresses despite controlled IOP,\n      surgery may be indicated. Deep sclerectomy with a collagen implant (DSCI) is a\n      non-penetrating surgical procedure for the treatment of open angle glaucoma that allows the\n      enhancement of the aqueous outflow. This forms the rationale to conduct this prospective,\n      open label study to assess the 24-hour IOP fluctuation profile recorded with Triggerfish\u00ae in\n      patients with POAG before and after DSCI.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -

 Not more than 4 diopters spherical equivalent on the study eye\n          -  Not more than 2 diopters cylinder equivalent on the study eye\n          -  Have given written informed consent, prior to any investigational procedures\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Corneal or conjunctival abnormality precluding contact lens adaptation\n          -  Severe dry eye syndrome\n          -  Patients with allergy to corneal anesthetic\n          -  Patients with contraindications for silicone contact lens wear\n          -  Patients not able to understand the character and individual consequences of the\n             investigation\n          -  Participation in other clinical research within the last 4 weeks\n", "cuis": "C0339573 C2751294 C0197557 C0021102 C1546675 C2926601 C1705850 C0231239 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0629359 C1552616 C1706244 C0339573 C0012621 C2926602 C0013103 C0040573 C1281294 C0005775 C1516559 C0020168 C0597811 C1442948 C0029130 C0346323 C1268985 C0376636 C0017601 C1962986 C0010957 C0029132 C3887709 C0155303 C0242656 C1522411 C3244315 C0013216 C0599938 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1820370 C0161479 C0180112 C2911690 C1531790 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0021102 C0021107 C1444656 C0017612 C0339573 C0543467 C1391251 C3846422 C0026035 C0038904 C0524850 C0524861 C3874032 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1627358 C2985765 C0231239 C1705425 C0947630 C0182913 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0011900 C0945731 C1301725 C1609436 C1547673 C0010957 C0010957 C0009253 C0947630 C0015392 C1137594 C0947630 C0015392 C0181797 C3245491 C1552578 C0013230 C0220825 C1261322 C0025664 C0184661 C3244317 C0009797 C0243161 C0009836 C3164991 C0848813 C0000934 C0871212 C0233532 C0009758 C2228431 C0153628 C0154025 C0229274 C0872390 C1278888 C1546576 C1550624 C1704258 C3809765 C0010031 C0153629 C0154026 C1278889 C1550625 C0013238 C1962953 C1547227 C1547231 C1561581 C4050465 C4050466 C0264097 C0002932 C0020517 C0489531 C1527304 C0719113 C0719656 C3247823 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0010031 C0010034 C0009836 C3164991 C0848813 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0162340 C0007952 C1299581 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0021228 C1552578 C3245491 C0220825 C1261322 C1553756 C1553854 C3272565 ", "concepts": "Primary Open Angle Glaucoma, Primary Open Angle Glaucoma-1O, Sclerectomy, Implanted, Implant, Implants, Before, Fluctuation, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Collagenan summary, summary Primary open angle glaucoma, Drainage, Drainage, Drainage trabecular meshwork, Trabecular meshwork, circulations, Circulation, humor, humor, lead optic nerves, Optic nerve, Optic nerve, management, glaucomas, Glaucoma, damage optic neuropathies, Optic neuropathy, Toxic optic neuropathy, progression, Border, orders drug therapy, nondrug therapy, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, flowering nerve damage, controllers, Controlled Deep sclerectomy, surgery, surgery, surgery:, implants, implant, Indicated open angle glaucoma, Prim open angle glaucoma, surgical procedure, c.surgical procedure, No surgical procedure, Microsurgical procedure, Minor surgical procedure, neurosurgical procedures, surgical procedures oral, Surgical procedure kit, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment Enhancement, Enhancement fluctuation, label, study, recorder criteria, Eligibility Criteria {Diagnosis}, Diagnosis documented, documented, Document, damage damage sex study, eye, herical study, eye, Cylinder investigational, investigation, investigational drug, Investigation, Investigation, procedures, Procedures, given, informed consent form Criteria contact lenses, contact lens, contact fit lens, adaptation, readaptation, Maladaptation, Conjunctiva, conjunctiva, Conjunctiva, Conjunctiva, Conjunctiva, Conjunctiva, Conjunctiva, Conjunctiva, Conjunctiva, Abnormality, No abnormality, Cornea, Cornea, Cornea, Cornea, Cornea dry eye syndromes, Dry eye syndrome, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Sever anesthetic, allergy, allergy, allergy, Callergy, dallergy, Dallergy, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, cornea, cornea contact lenses, contact lens, contact fit lens, contraindication, Contraindication, Contraindication, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient understand, character, able, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, individuality investigation, investigational, Investigation, Investigation ParticipationMode, ParticipationType, Clinical "}
