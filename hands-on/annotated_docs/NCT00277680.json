{"text": "TITLE:\n      Laparoscopic Occlusion of Uterine Vessels Compared to Uterine Fibroid Embolization for Treatment of Uterine Fibroids\nSUMMARY:\n      Women with symptomatic uterine fibroids are treated either by Uterine Fibroid Embolization\n      (UFE) or laparoscopic occlusion. The study hypothesis is that laparoscopic occlusion of\n      uterine vessels and UFE have equal effect on bleeding symptoms. Menstrual bleeding reduction\n      six months after treatment is the main endpoint. Secondary endpoints include participants\n      assessment of symptom relief, and volume reduction of fibroids measured by MRI. We will also\n      investigate possible differences in postoperative course, symptom reduction, complication,\n      and recurrence. Patients are controlled with regular intervals up to five years after\n      treatment.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE)has become an alternative to hysterectomy for women with\n      symptoms of uterine fibroids.Follow up studies of this new method have reported relief of\n      menstrual bleeding by 85-90 % of the patients six to twelve months after treatment.Other\n      studies have suggested laparoscopic bilateral occlusion of uterine arteries as an equal\n      effective alternative, but to our knowledge there is no randomized studies published.\n      Patients recruitment : Women with symptoms of uterine fibroids referred to the clinic,who\n      express a desire to avoid hysterectomy.\n      Study hypothesis: Laparoscopic occlusion of uterine vessels and UFE have equal effect on\n      bleeding symptoms.\n      Gynecological examination, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are\n      performed preoperatively and after 1,3 and 6 months. Clinical follow up is planned after\n      1,3,6,12,24,36 and 60 months.A validated bleeding chard, Pictorial Blood Assessment\n      Chart(PBAC)is filled in by the participants during the last menstruation period before\n      treatment and before each control. A standardized questionnaire to assess the bleeding\n      amount,pressure symptoms, pain, adverse events, other complains and patients satisfaction is\n      also used.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Menorrhagia and/or bulk symptoms associated with uterine fibroids\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Malignancy\n          -  Current or planned pregnancy\n          -  Small submucous fibroids suitable for hysteroscopic resection\n          -  Postmenopausal women\n          -  Suspected or known adenomyosis\n          -  Uterus size exceeding the umbilical level\n          -  Contraindications against laparoscopic surgery\n", "cuis": "C0042133 C0031150 C0023036 C1883297 C0013931 C0028778 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0042149 C0005847
