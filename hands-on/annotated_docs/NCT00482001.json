{"text": "TITLE:\n      Impact of Cholinesterase Inhibitors on Driving Ability in Healthy Older Adults\nSUMMARY:\n      The goal of the study is to assess the role of cholinesterase inhibitors in affecting the\n      driving ability of cognitively intact seniors using driving simulators. We hypothesize that\n      the use of a cholinesterase inhibitor for two weeks will be associated with improvement in\n      safe driving behavior on a simulated driving task.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and while it is known that AD\n      poses substantial risks of motor vehicle collisions, many people in the earliest stages of\n      AD continue to drive. Memory problems themselves are poor predictors of who is actually\n      unsafe on the road, and various medications that are used to treat people with AD may impact\n      on their driving abilities. Donepezil is a drug used to treat the memory problems associated\n      with AD. While previous studies have shown that it slows the decline of activities of daily\n      living (eg. shopping, banking, dressing) and may improve the ability of younger pilots to\n      perform on computerized flight simulators, no studies have examined the impact of donepezil\n      on driving abilities in older adults.\n      The present investigation is a pilot study aiming to determine if donepezil helps healthy\n      older drivers perform on driving simulators. Two Canadian academic centers have different\n      driving simulators - one in Toronto and one in Thunder Bay. At each of these centers, ten\n      healthy men aged 65 to 75 will be randomly assigned to receive either donepezil 5mg/day or\n      identical placebo for two weeks.\n      Using the driving simulator, we will assess various aspects of driving ability. These\n      measures of driving performance will be compared between those who received the drug and\n      those who received the placebo.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  valid Ontario driver's license\n          -  active driver (greater than or equal to three times per week)\n          -  written, informed consent\n          -  lives in Toronto/Thunder Bay\n          -  healthy\n          -  Male between 65-75 years old\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  cognitive impairment\n          -  psychiatric history\n          -  sleep disorder history\n          -  substance abuse\n          -  neurological history\n          -  medical illness\n          -  ophthalmological disease\n          -  psychoactive medications\n          -  contra-indications to Donepezil\n          -  experience car/motion sickness\n", "cuis": "C0008425 C3536756 C0001046 C4050139 C1552616 C1706244 C0008425 C0001046 C0877006 C0596537 C0947630 C0018017 C1704326 C0183309 C0175727 C0008425 C0877006 C0001046 C0596537 C3844714 C0677505 C2707008 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0002395 C1271045 C0338450 C0477364 C1521724 C0011265 C0497327 C3245511 C3845898 C0337196 C1300072 C0025260 C0013126 C0033213 C2081614 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 C0233794 C0527316 C0013227 C1254351 C0231170 C2239122 C2004436 C0947630 C2350011 C0349389 C1830414 C0013119 C0278286 C0518459 C0152053 C0183309 C0175727 C0527316 C0332128 C0000589 C0025638 C0947630 C1555709 C1948032 C0231170 C1552578 C3245491 C0220825 C1261322 C0527316 C0947630 C0183309 C0175727 C3242376 C0542279 C1555709 C1948032 C0238884 C0183309 C0175727 C0527316 C1552601 C1561538 C0032042 C0183309 C0040399 C0013227 C1254351 C0032042 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0421231 C2960399 C1561540 C1320102 C0542279 C0013126 C0009797 C0595998 C0243161 C0338656 C1270972 C3554639 C0262926 C2004062 C1548428 C3526598 C0037317 C0851578 C0751772 C0262926 C2004062 C0740858 C0747752 C0013146 C0038577 C0262926 C2004062 C2707261 C3845870 C0221423 C0424228 C0012634 C0018609 C2013096 C0430860 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 C0527316 C0026603 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 ", "concepts": "Cholinesterase Inhibitor, Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor, Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor, Driving summary, summary Cholinesterase Inhibitors, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, Cholinesterase inhibition, esterase inhibitors, study, goal, role simulators, Stimulators Cholinesterase inhibitor drug, cholinesterase inhibition, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, esterase inhibitor, No improvement behaviors, Behavior description, prescription, prescription Alzheimer's disease, NOS, FH: Alzheimer's disease, Focal Alzheimer's disease, Other Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's Disease, dementia, dementia, common, Uknown collisions, stage Memory, drive, problem, problem: medications, medications:, Medications, Medications, medication:, Premedications memory problems, Donepezil, drug, drug, disabilities activities, activities:, studies shopping, hopping, Shopping, Dressing, Dressing, Dressing, Dressing simulators, Stimulators, donepezil, Examined, Mexamine, Hexamine, studies folder, Folder, disabilities investigation, investigational, Investigation, Investigation, donepezil, study simulators, Stimulators, academic, drivers, folder, Folder, canadian simulators, Stimulators donepezil, assigned, day placebo simulator, spects drug, drug placebo criteria, Eligibility Criteria Driver's license, Has driver's license week, Factive, drivers, drive informed consent form lives Criteria cognitive impairment, Mild cognitive impairment, Severe cognitive impairment history, history, Psychiatric, Psychiatric sleep disorders, sleep disorders, REM sleep disorder, history, history rndx substance abuse, multisubstance abuse, substance abuse drug, substance abuse test history, history, Neurological, ICU.neurological illness, Stillness disease, h disease, ophthalmologicals, ophthalmological tests medications, medications:, Medications, Medications, medication:, Premedications Donepezil motion sickness, experience, experience, Inexperience "}
