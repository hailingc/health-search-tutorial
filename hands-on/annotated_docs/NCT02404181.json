{"text": "TITLE:\n      Validation of a Delirium Monitor\nSUMMARY:\n      Delirium is a common disorder in hospitalized patients, nevertheless it is poorly recognized\n      by physicians and nurses, even when screening instruments are used. Electroencephalography\n      (EEG) appears to be a sensitive tool for the diagnosis of delirium. However, standard EEG\n      recording with 25 electrodes is labor intensive. We have previously showed that a brief EEG\n      registration with three electrodes and automatic processing can distinguish patients with\n      delirium from patients without delirium very well. However, these findings need to be\n      validated in an unselected population.\n      The primary objective of this validation study is to investigate the sensitivity,\n      specificity, and predictive values of the EEG-based delirium monitor (including three\n      electrodes and a reference electrode) compared to delirium quantification in frail elderly\n      patients after surgery.\n      In an international multicenter study, 154 frail elderly patients will be included who will\n      undergo elective surgery and are expected to remain admitted for at least two postoperative\n      days. Patients are excluded if communication is not possible or admitted for neurological\n      surgery.\n      A five minute EEG registration with the delirium monitor with four electrodes will be\n      performed prior surgery and three consecutive days after surgery or until discharge. Within\n      one hour of the EEG recording, the delirium assessment will be performed and recorded on\n      video, which will be evaluated by delirium experts. The relative delta power (calculated\n      from one minute of artifact-free EEG segment) will be compared with the conclusion of the\n      delirium experts.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  60 years and older\n          -  Frail\n          -  Undergoing elective surgery\n          -  Expected to remain admitted for at least 2 postoperative days\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  No communication possible due to a language barrier or deafness\n          -  Admission for neurological surgery\n          -  Participation in this study during a previous hospital admission\n          -  Practical or logistical reasons hampering the use of the delirium monitor, such as\n             technical failure of the monitor\n          -  Isolation because of known carrier ship of a resistant bacterium\n", "cuis": "C0011206 C0181904 C0596972 C1552616 C1706244 C0701159 C0011206 C0012634 C3245511 C0013819 C0443310 C2183235 C1527380 C3879054 C0348000 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0011206 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0020517 C0013812 C0022864 C1553384 C1514821 C1318313 C0013812 C0011206 C1268649 C0681836 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0237677 C0020517 C0312418 C0427965 C0011206 C0030695 C0150369 C0181904 C0013812 C1514811 C1561577 C1546616 C1550631 C0011206 C0871754 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0947630 C0871754 C0206058 C0184666 C0809949 C4055646 C1517001 C2024161 C0184666 C0809949 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552867 C2707261 C3845870 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C1553384 C1514821 C1318313 C0013812 C0011206 C0030695 C0150369 C0181904 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C0011206 C0182913 C0011206 C1443182 C1441792 C0220825 C3172260 C0011206 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1555709 C1948032 C0871754 C0206058 C1517001 C0184666 C0809949 C2024161 C0243161 C0237167 C0011053 C0018772 C0524850 C2224801 C1369665 C0184666 C0809949 C0184666 C3696800 C0488547 C0489545 C0600290 C0947630 C1553756 C1553854 C0011206 C0030695 C0150369 C0181904 C0030695 C0150369 C0181904 C0204727 C0260397 C0220862 C2064685 C0007294 C1514892 C2827757 C4038931 C3845898 ", "concepts": "Delirium, Monitors, Monitor summary, summary hospitalized, Delirium, disorder, common electroencephalogram, Electroencephalographs, electroencephalography, Electroencephalograms, Electroencephalograph tester, instruments, screening, Screening, screening, screening, Screening diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, delirium, standards, Standard, Standard, Sensitive electrodes, labor registration, Registration, Jaw registration, electrodes delirium, findings new validation study, Objective, objective, Objective, insensitivity, Sensitivity, Sensitivity, Sensitivity delirium, monitor, monitor, monitor electrodes, reference, Reference, Electrode, Electrode, delirium, frail surgery, surgery, surgery: study, frail elective surgery, admitted, Admitted, Unexpected, Expected, postoperative VSD admitted, Admitted, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, exclude, Neurological, ICU.neurological surgery, surgery, surgery: registration, Registration, Jaw registration, electrodes, delirium, monitor, monitor, monitor Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, surgery, surgery, surgery: Assessment, assessments, Assessment, Assessment, IQ assessment, delirium, recorder delirium, Calculated, US.calculated, Evaluated, Relative delirium criteria, Eligibility Criteria folder, Folder Frail elective surgery Expected, admitted, Admitted, postoperative VSD Criteria language barrier, Deafness, deafness neurological surgery, neurological spinal surgery, Neurological surgery Note, admission, Admission hospital admission, 3 at hospital admission, Hospital admission Dx, Hospital admission Dx, hospital readmission, study, ParticipationMode, ParticipationType delirium, monitor, monitor, monitor monitor, monitor, monitor isolation, [V]Isolation, isolation, isolation, carrier, Resistant, Resistant, Bacterium, Uknown "}
