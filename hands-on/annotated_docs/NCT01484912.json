{"text": "TITLE:\n      Phase II Study of STA-2 in Patients With Chronic Stable Angina\nSUMMARY:\n      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, pharmacological activities and\n      safety of STA-2 in the treatment of chronic stable angina.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of STA-2 in the management\n      of chronic stable angina. The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety\n      and pharmacological activities of STA-2 in the management of chronic stable angina. This was\n      a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study of STA-2\n      in the management of chronic stable angina. The study period for each patient was\n      approximately 7 weeks, during which the patient undergone one-week screening and washout\n      period, followed by 6 weeks of treatment. Each patient was required to make a total of 5\n      visits. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change in total exercise time.\n      After washout, patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned\n      either to the treatment or control group. The respective regimens were:\n      Treatment group:\n      STA-2 250 mg capsule, each containing 100 mg green tea polyphenols, 2 capsules ter in die\n      (t.i.d.=three times daily) for 6 weeks, to be administered in a non-fasting state.\n      Control group:\n      Placebo 250 mg capsule, 2 capsules t.i.d. (three times daily) for 6 weeks, to be\n      administered in a non-fasting state.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion criteria:\n          1. Male or female aged > 20;\n          2. Patients who had effort-induced angina which was relieved by rest or nitroglycerin,\n             or who had catheterization-documented coronary artery disease or previous myocardial\n             infarction \u2265 3 months before screening;\n          3. Patients who manifested positive ETT (exercise tolerance testing) (defined as\n             ST-segment depression \u2265 1 mm compared with at rest, with or without limiting angina)\n             at screening (Day -7);\n          4. Patients who manifested positive ETT (exercise tolerance testing) (defined as\n             ST-segment depression \u2265 1 mm compared with at rest, with or without limiting angina)\n             on the day of enrollment (Day 0). ETT performance between Day -7 and Day 0 were\n             required not differ by >20% in total exercise time;\n          5. Female patient who was in the post-menopausal stage or of childbearing potential who:\n               -  used adequate contraception since last menstruation and no plan for conception\n                  during the study;\n               -  was non-lactating;\n               -  had negative pregnancy test (urine) within 14 days prior to the study;\n          6. Able to provide written informed consent.\n        Exclusion criteria:\n          1. Patients with pre-excitation, conduction abnormalities, pacemaker rhythm, unstable\n             angina or myocardial infarction within the preceding 3 months;\n          2. Patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV), uncorrected\n             valvular or congenital heart disease, patients who needed digoxin, isosorbide\n             mononitrate, nitroglycerin sustained release preparation, theophylline, class I\n             antiarrhythmic agents, digitalis, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, as judged by the\n             investigator;\n          3. Patients with any EKG abnormalities preventing the interpretation of ischemia\n             (complete left bundle branch block);\n          4. Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) requiring bronchodilators;\n          5. Patients with hepatic failure (defined as aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine\n             transaminase (ALT) > 3X the upper limit of normal values), and/or renal failure\n             (defined as serum creatinine > 3 mg/dL);\n          6. Patients with severe gastrointestinal illness as judged by the investigator;\n          7. Patient with any conditions that interfered the performance of exercise tolerance\n             test as judged by investigator (e.g., knee/ankle arthropathy, Parkinsonism, stroke).\n", "cuis":
