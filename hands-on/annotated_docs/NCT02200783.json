{"text": "TITLE:\n      Randomized Comparison of Radiological Exposure With TRIPTable\u00ae in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes\nSUMMARY:\n      Excessive radiation received by the operator has been described as a possible drawback of\n      the radial catheterization technique when compared with the femoral access.\n      The study hypothesis is that the use of radial access device dedicated radioprotective\n      TRIPTable \u00ae (Transradial Intervention Table Protection) is not inferior to standard femoral\n      technique and superior to standard radial technique as radioprotection strategy to the\n      operator in patients with acute coronary syndromes acute and submitted to cardiac\n      catheterization.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This study is prospective, 1:1:1 randomized, unicentric, comparative between femoral and\n      radial radial technique with and without dedicated TRIPTable \u00ae device.\n      The TripTable device is a polycarbonate support table anatomically-designed to facilitate\n      the radial technique, facilitating the puncturing, positioning, support to work material and\n      providing further radioprotection from a lead layer without obstruction in viewing the\n      fluoroscopic images.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Unstable angina with an indication for invasive stratification\n          -  Acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation\n          -  Acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation\n          -  Patient informed of the nature of the study and have signed the Informed Consent\n          -  Patient suitable for coronary angiography and / or percutaneous coronary intervention\n             either by radial access as the femoral\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Below 18 years of age\n          -  Pregnancy\n          -  Chronic use of vitamin K antagonists, or direct thrombin inhibitors or antagonists of\n             factor Xa,\n          -  Active bleeding or high risk of bleeding (severe hepatic insufficiency, active peptic\n             ulcer disease, creatinine clearance <30 mL / min, platelet count <100,000 mm3);\n          -  Uncontrolled hypertension;\n          -  Cardiogenic shock;\n          -  Previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery with the use of \u2265 1 graft\n          -  Patients not candidates for the use of any of the specified vascular access\n          -  Concomitant severe disease with life expectancy less than 12 months life;\n          -  Medical, geographical, or social conditions that impede study participation\n          -  Refusal or inability to understand and sign the informed consent form.\n", "cuis": "C0948089 C0274281 C0332157 C2220266 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C3897779 C1552616 C1706244 C1522449 C1524020 C1963223 C1705273 C2827501 C0007430 C0191117 C2025500 C2025504 C0398266 C0770826 C0015811 C0025664 C0947630 C3812868 C3812869 C0034533 C1273869 C1948041 C2979881 C0886296 C1545588 C0015811 C1706074 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0034533 C0679199 C0025664 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0948089 C0018787 C1705273 C2827501 C0007430 C0191117 C2025500 C2025504 C0398266 C0770826 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0015811 C0947630 C0025664 C3812868 C3812869 C0223697 C0034518 C0542141 C0816588 C2363059 C1547311 C0150305 C0556030 C1561964 C0025664 C0034533 C0028778 C0934502 C1442948 C0699530 C0282443 C1696103 C0016356 C0180921 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0002965 C0340288 C1334278 C0948089 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0948089 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C1631603 C1561610 C2090600 C0947630 C0009797 C1880840 C0085532 C1633729 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0018787 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0015811 C0243161 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C2746042 C0003440 C3541936 C1547296 C1555457 C0042890 C0003968 C0005575 C0016410 C0035527 C0042839 C0042866 C3537249 C0042874 C0078364 C2064899 C3244286 C0381385 C1306571 C0019080 C0718247 C1306232 C1320102 C0373595 C0812399 C0032181 C1287267 C0392386 C0857460 C0012634 C0018609 C0041582 C1868885 C0036980 C0010055 C1260596 C0396756 C0396767 C0396777 C0396783 C0396789 C1449706 C1532296 C2889860 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0750138 C0042371 C0280956 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C4048188 C0012634 C0018609 C1306232 C1561542 C0199168 C1561579 C0947630 C0012634 C0009797 C0162340 ", "concepts": "Acute Coronary Syndromes, exposure, exposure, exposure, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Randomiz summary, summary Radiation, Radiation, Radiation, Operator, Operator catheterization, IVC catheterization, IVC catheterization, SVC catheterization, vein catheterization, catheterization kits, femoral, techniques study, Medicated, Medicated, radioprotection Interventions, intervention, Interventions, interventions, Protection, femoral, Table, standards, Standard, Standard radioprotection, strategy, techniques, standards, Standard, Standard acute coronary syndromes, cardiac, Operator, Operator catheterization, IVC catheterization, IVC catheterization, SVC catheterization, vein catheterization, catheterization kits description, prescription, prescription femoral, study techniques, Medicated, Medicated, radial neck, radial nerve, radial palsy, Fossa radial, radial pulse Stable positioning, Repositioning, Positioning, techniques radioprotection, obstruction, layer, lead, providine, reviewing image, fluoroscopy, fluoroscope criteria, Eligibility Criteria Unstable angina, stable angina, Invasive Acute coronary syndrome, elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation Acute coronary syndrome, elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation Patient informed, signed, signed:, study, Informed Consent Forms, Informed Consent Form coronary angiogram, Coronary angiogram, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, coronary, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient femoral Criteria pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
