{"text": "TITLE:\n      Should the Joint Capsule of the Painful Stiff Shoulder be Ruptured During Intra-articular Hydraulic Distension?\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of intra-articular hydraulic distension\n      (IHD) for the treatment of painful stiff shoulders between capsule-rupturing and\n      capsule-preserving IHDs.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The Painful stiff shoulder (PSS), or the adhesive capsulitis, involves stiff and contracted\n      joint capsule from fibrosis in the glenohumeral joint. Intra-articular hydraulic distension\n      (IHD) enlarges the stiffened capsule by deforming it with excessive volume and pressure\n      within the joint space. Although IHD is one of the most common treatment options for the\n      PSS, the diversity of the IHD technique spans wide range. Specifically, it is not generally\n      agreed as for which, between capsule-rupturing and capsule-preserving IHDs, is superior for\n      PSS treatment. Capsule-preserving IHD might fail to infuse sufficient amount of fluid to\n      avoid rupture, thus producing less satisfactory outcomes. However, we devised in our\n      previous study a novel technique that enabled a physician to infuse the possible largest\n      volume without rupturing the capsule. By employing the technique, we aim to compare the\n      clinical efficacy of capsule-rupturing versus capsule-preserving IHDs in patients with PSSs.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  shoulder discomfort for at least one month\n          -  limited range of motion of the glenohumeral joint in at least two directions\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  systemic inflammatory joint disease\n          -  radiological evidence of bony abnormality of the shoulder\n          -  full-thickness rotator cuff tear\n          -  acute systemic medical illness\n          -  history of major trauma or surgery involving the shoulder\n          -  contraindication to intra-articular, local anesthestic injection\n", "cuis": "C0206207 C0012359 C0037004 C0869975 C1283792 C0030193 C3203359 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C0012359 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0037004 C3203359 C0030193 C0151744 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0158300 C0241042 C0030193 C0332522 C1548281 C0206207 C0016059 C0012359 C0460139 C0151744 C0683525 C3245511 C0151744 C0221874 C0151744 C0025664 C2702329 C3203359 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0524463 C0151744 C0016286 C3203359 C1547307 C0947630 C0679622 C0025664 C0562342 C1171285 C0804815 C3203359 C0557351 C0025664 C3203359 C3272565 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1096593 C1561542 C0231589 C0243161 C0022408 C0442743 C0003209 C0037004 C0524468 C0524469 C0869975 C1283792 C1704258 C3809765 C0263912 C0221423 C0424228 C0332677 C0037004 C0524468 C0524469 C0869975 C1283792 C0262926 C2004062 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C0021485 C1533685 C0444600 C0021493 C0002921 C0002934 ", "concepts": "Joint Capsule, Distension, Shoulders, Shoulder, Shoulder, Painful, Rupture summary, summary study, Distension Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, shoulders, rupturing, painful, ihd description, prescription, prescription adhesive capsulitis, stiff shoulder, Painful, contract, contract joint capsule, fibrosis, Distension pressure, ihd treatment options, common, ihd, spacer ihd, techniques, Orange rupturing Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, Capsule, ihd, fluids rupture, Satisfactory study, novel, techniques, enable, enable, Physician rupturing, employing, techniques rupturing, Clinical criteria, Eligibility Criteria shoulder discomfort, month limited range of motion Criteria joint disease, Noninflammatory, Antiinflammatory shoulders, R shoulder, L shoulder, Shoulder, Shoulder, Abnormality, No abnormality rotator cuff tear illness, Stillness major trauma, shoulders, R shoulder, L shoulder, Shoulder, Shoulder, history, history, surgery, surgery, surgery: contraindication, Contraindication, Contraindication, injections, injection, Reinjection, IP injection, Local anesthesia, Local anesthetic "}
