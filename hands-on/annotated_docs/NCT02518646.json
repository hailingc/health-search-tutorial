However, the use of these prediction models is not\n      yet implemented as standard in clinical practice, as it is unknown which delirium prediction\n      model can best be used to predict delirium in ICU patients.Therefore the main aim of this\n      study is to compare the performance of the PRE-DELIRIC model and the E-PRE-DELRIC model.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Delirium often occurs in ICU patients and is associated with negative consequences,\n      requiring prevention. A prediction model facilitates the identification of those patients at\n      risk for delirium and therefore need prevention the most. At present, two ICU delirium\n      prediction models are available. First the PRE-DELIRIC model was developed. This recently\n      recalibrated model reliably predicts ICU patients' risk for delirium within 24 hours after\n      ICU admission. Because a relevant number of patients develops delirium during the first 24\n      hours after ICU admission, and prevention ideally should be deployed as soon as possible,\n      the investigators developed the 'early prediction model' (E-PRE-DELIRIC) which reliably\n      predicts delirium immediately after ICU admission. To implement a delirium prediction model\n      in clinical practice, one needs to know which model best can be used. Currently, the use of\n      a delirium prediction model is not implemented as standard in clinical practice, as this\n      information is unavailable. Therefore the main aim of this study is to compare the\n      (predictive and clinical) performance of the PRE-DELIRIC model and the E-PRE-DELRIC model.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  ICU patients aged \u226518 years;\n          -  Surgical, medical, neurology/neurosurgical, or trauma patients.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Delirious at ICU admission;\n          -  Expected ICU stay shorter than 6 hours;\n          -  Unable to reliably assess ICU delirium due to:\n          -  sustained coma during entire ICU stay;\n          -  unable to understand the language spoken;\n          -  severely mentally disabled;\n          -  serious receptive aphasia;\n          -  serious auditory or visual disorders.\n", "cuis": "C0011206 C3161035 C2347274 C0018670 C0876917 C1281590 C1552616 C1706244 C0011206 C3853906 C3853906 C0237607 C3245512 C0011206 C1556133 C3541433 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C3272565 C0011206 C3853906 C0947630 C3853906 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0011206 C1513916 C0199176 C3853906 C0020792 C3516629 C0150323 C0277767 C0557971 C0199176 C0011206 C3853906 C2363670 C0011206 C3853906 C3858758 C0184666 C0809949 C0011206 C2360800 C0199176 C0184666 C0809949 C3853906 C2363670 C3858758 C0184666 C0809949 C0011206 C3853906 C1697779 C0237607 C3245512 C3853906 C3272565 C0011206 C0237607 C3245512 C3853906 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C3272565 C0947630 C3242430 C1561528 C3853906 C3272565 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0543467 C0587668 C3263723 C3714660 C0243161 C0011206 C0184666 C0809949 C1517001 C0011206 C1299582 C3858758 C0009421 C0162340 C1299582 C0424919 C0454578 C0012634 C0007222 C0017178 ", "concepts": "Delirium, Models, Unit, Head, Head, Head summary, summary delirium, model model practices, practice, delirium, unknown, unknown, standards, Standard, Standard, Clinical delirium, model study, model description, prescription, prescription Delirium, Negative prevention, model, Identification, Sex identification, Risk identification, Body identification, Goal identification prevention, delirium model, developer delirium, model, reliable admissions, Admission, delirium, Number of patients prevention, admissions, Admission model, developer, reliable admissions, Admission, delirium, model, immediate practices, practice, model, Clinical delirium, practices, practice, model, standards, Standard, Standard, Clinical study, informational, Information model, Clinical criteria, Eligibility Criteria Surgically, Surgical, trauma, trauma Criteria Delirious, admissions, Admission Expected delirium, Unable, reliable coma understand, unable, Language spoken receptive aphasia disorders, CV disorders, GI disorders "}
