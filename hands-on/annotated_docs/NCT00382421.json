{"text": "TITLE:\n      Study to Investigate Effects of Antiischemic Drug Therapy in Silent Ischemia\nSUMMARY:\n      There is a lack of data on the prognostic importance of silent ischemia in totally\n      asymptomatic subjects without history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and, particularly,\n      on a possible benefit of medical therapy in such patients. SWISSI 1 therefore recruits\n      totally asymptomatic subjects older than 40 years of age without any history of CAD but one\n      cardiovascular risk factor with documented silent ischemia. Participants are randomized to\n      open antianginal drug therapy and risk factor control versus only risk factor management and\n      followed up for \u2265 10 years.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Although there is still controversy regarding why ischemic episodes are symptomatic in some\n      patients and completely asymptomatic in others, it is now widely accepted that silent\n      ischemia, like symptomatic episodes, negatively affects prognosis. Silent ischemia may occur\n      in totally asymptomatic patients without (type I) or with a history (type II) of an ischemic\n      cardiac event and coexists with symptomatic episodes in many patients (type III). However,\n      there is a lack of data on the prognostic importance of silent ischemia in totally\n      asymptomatic subjects without history of coronary artery disease (CAD), i.e. silent ischemia\n      type I, and, particularly, on a possible benefit of medical therapy in such patients.\n      Reasons lie in the difficulty to identify such patients and their expected low event rates\n      implying that large patient populations and/or long follow-up periods would be necessary to\n      come to definite conclusions. Still, to address this problem, we perform SWISSI 1 which\n      includes totally asymptomatic subjects older than 40 years of age without any history of CAD\n      but one cardiovascular risk factor with documented silent ischemia. They are randomized to\n      open antianginal drug therapy and risk factor control versus only risk factor management and\n      followed up for \u2265 10 years.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Documented silent myocardial ischemia type I\n          -  At least one cardiovascular risk factor\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  History of cardiovascular disease\n", "cuis": "C0013216 C0022116 C3816734 C0947630 C1552616 C1706244 C0220901 C0022116 C3245479 C1328018 C0010054 C1956346 C0010068 C0231221 C0343751 C0262926 C2004062 C0418981 C2069680 C0231221 C0343751 C0262926 C2004062 C1555709 C1948032 C0850624 C1301725 C1609436 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C0022116 C0013216 C0599938 C3537168 C0376636 C0455624 C1553898 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0231221 C0022116 C0231221 C0343751 C0033325 C3854082 C0022116 C3816734 C0231221 C0001721 C2237113 C0231221 C0343751 C0262926 C2004062 C0022116 C0741923 C0231221 C0220901 C0022116 C3245479 C0010054 C1956346 C0010068 C0231221 C0343751 C0022116 C0262926 C2004062 C0418981 C2069680 C1299586 C3842554 C1550472 C3858576 C4055646 C1517001 C0729829 C0025344 C0033213 C2081614 C1410088 C0963149 C0376649 C0231221 C0343751 C0262926 C2004062 C1555709 C1948032 C0850624 C1301725 C1609436 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C0022116 C0013216 C0599938 C3537168 C0376636 C0455624 C1553898 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0340291 C0010054 C0151744 C1278536 C1301725 C1609436 C1547673 C0850624 C0243161 C0455539 C0455404 C0455346 ", "concepts": "Drug Therapy, Ischemia, Silent, Study summary, summary prognostic, ischemia, data, Therex coronary artery diseases, CAD (coronary artery disease), coronary diseases, asymptomatic, asymptomatic HIV, history, history Medical therapy, medical therapy asymptomatic, asymptomatic HIV, history, history, folder, Folder cardiovascular risk factor, Documented, Documented, document, document, document, ischemia drug therapy, nondrug therapy, antianginal, management, risk factors, risk factors description, prescription, prescription Asymptomatic, ischemia asymptomatic, asymptomatic HIV prognosis, Prognosis, ischemia, Silent, Asymptomatic, affect, affect asymptomatic, asymptomatic HIV, history, history, ischemia cardiac event, Asymptomatic prognostic, ischemia, data coronary artery diseases, CAD (coronary artery disease), coronary diseases, asymptomatic, asymptomatic HIV, ischemia, history, history Medical therapy, medical therapy difficulty, No difficulty, low, deidentify, Unexpected, Expected, urates periods problem, problem:, Still, definity, addresses asymptomatic, asymptomatic HIV, history, history, folder, Folder cardiovascular risk factor, Documented, Documented, document, document, document, ischemia drug therapy, nondrug therapy, antianginal, management, risk factors, risk factors criteria, Eligibility Criteria silent myocardial ischemia, myocardial ischemia, myocardial ischemia, Transient myocardial ischemia, documented, documented, Document cardiovascular risk factor Criteria History of cardiovascular disease (situation), Family history of cardiovascular disease, No family history of cardiovascular disease "}
