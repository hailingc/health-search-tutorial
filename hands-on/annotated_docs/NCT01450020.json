{"text": "TITLE:\n      Peer Navigator Education in Improving Survivorship Care in African American Breast Cancer Survivors\nSUMMARY:\n      This randomized clinical trial studies peer navigator education in improving survivorship\n      care in African American breast cancer survivors. An educational intervention involving peer\n      groups may help to improve the well-being and quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer\n      survivors\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n      I. To evaluate the ability of peer navigation (PN) to improve understanding of survivorship\n      care planning (SCP) at 6 months.\n      II. To promote adherence to the SCP schedule of follow-up examinations at 12 months.\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n      I. To evaluate the effect of PN on change from baseline in medical efficacy, preparedness\n      for life as new survivor, and physical and health related QOL at 6 months.\n      OUTLINE: PNs are trained on medical issues and resources, and SCP. Participants are then\n      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n      ARM I: Participants receive 4 PN sessions tailored to their needs followed by a 6 month\n      booster session and American Cancer Society (ACS) materials.\n      ARM II: Participants receive ACS materials.\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 months.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  TRIAL SUBJECTS:\n          -  Patient age 18 years or older who self-identifies as African-American\n          -  In early survivorship phase, defined as being 1-12 months post completion of\n             treatment for stage 0-3 breast cancer\n          -  Receiving health care primarily through an health maintenance organization (HMO)\n          -  Patients with metastatic cancer or a second primary cancer, because their medical\n             characteristics (e.g. disease progression) are significantly different\n          -  Breast cancer survivors (BCS) with other major disabling medical, psychiatric, or\n             substance abuse conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression, alcohol/tobacco problems) will\n             be excluded\n          -  PEER NAVIGATORS:\n          -  At least 25 years of age who self-identifies as African-American\n          -  Previously participated in any type of research study\n          -  Has at least high school education\n          -  Has been diagnosed with breast cancer, currently in remission or eradicated\n          -  Belongs to a breast cancer support group\n          -  Has a valid driver's license\n          -  Owns an operational vehicle\n          -
