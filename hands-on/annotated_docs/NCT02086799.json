{"text": "TITLE:\n      Thyroid Hormones Treatment in Asthma Exacerbation\nSUMMARY:\n      This study will explore whether supplementation with thyroid hormones in the set-up of\n      asthma exacerbation could improve the clinical outcomes.\n      The study will include adults admitted to Rambam health care campus for moderate to severe\n      Asthma exacerbation.\n      The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.\n      Patients will be randomized on admission to receive treatment with intra-venous thyroxine\n      (100mcg once on admission and additional 100mcg after 12 hours) or placebo. The study\n      treatment will be given only after the initial bronchodilator therapy, oxygen and informed\n      consent are given. The primary endpoint is the time to return of the peak expiratory flow\n      (PEF) rate to normal values or personal base line.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Study population: The study will include adults admitted to Internal Medicine B (IMB)\n      department, Internal Medicine H (IMH) department or medical intensive care unit (MICU) in\n      Rambam-Health Care Campus for moderate to severe Asthma exacerbation. The severity of the\n      exacerbation will be based on several acceptable clinical and laboratory criteria, including\n      breathless, alertness, pulse rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial\n      blood (PaO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2), oxygen\n      saturation, peak expiratory flow (PEF). Study protocol: The study is a prospective,\n      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Patients will be randomized on\n      admission to receive treatment with intra-venous thyroxine (100mcg once on admission and\n      additional 100mcg after 12 hours) or placebo. The study treatment will be given only after\n      the initial bronchodilator therapy, oxygen and informed consent are given. The primary\n      endpoint is the time to return of the PEF rate to normal values or personal base line. PEF\n      rates will be examined first after initial bronchodilator therapy and then, every 8 hours.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  18 years of age or older\n          -  Known Asthma\n          -  The exacerbation is defined as moderate or severe.\n          -  Not currently enrolled as an active participant in another clinical trial of a\n             medical therapy or device.\n          -  The patient or first degree family relative (in cases where the patient is intubated)\n             has authorized his/her consent to participate in this trial. The patient will be\n             asked to give his consent only after initial bronchodilator therapy\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  60 years of age or older\n          -  Known thyroid disorders\n          -  Subject where thyrotoxicosis is suspected\n          -  Known heart disease\n          -  Heart rate > 140\n", "cuis": "C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0040132 C0040134 C0004096 C1552616 C1706244 C0242297 C0556088 C2935799 C2350507 C3537005 C0040132 C0040134 C2228489 C0076638 C0117002 C0947630 C0036849 C0180799 C0349790 C3272565 C0086388 C0184666 C0809949 C0947630 C1306232 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C0004096 C1096775 C0032042 C0947630 C0456909 C0180112 C2911690 C0184666 C0809949 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0040165 C0079691 C0202231 C1281902 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0184666 C0809949 C0032042 C0947630 C0578554 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0030054 C0184633 C3244317 C0562357 C1518922 C0030735 C1542834 C2986535 C3244317 C1553386 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0184666 C0809949 C0013227 C3243280 C0947630 C0085559 C0013227 C3243280 C0086388 C0004096 C1306232 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C2983285 C0243161 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C3272565 C0231832 C0489258 C0231837 C0429743 C0436708 C0013404 C0232117 C1443086 C0460139 C0030054 C0184633 C0003842 C0460139 C0678717 C0030054 C0184633 C0005768 C0229664 C1822070 C0202155 C1822073 C0003842 C1518922 C0030735 C1542834 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0947630 C0746961 C0678723 C1254042 C0523807 C1096775 C0032042 C0456909 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0180112 C2911690 C0184666 C0809949 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0040165 C0079691 C0202231 C1281902 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0032042 C0947630 C3244317 C0578554 C0030054 C0184633 C3244317 C0009797 C1553386 C0578554 C0332128 C0000589 C0025638 C0729829 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1555709 C1948032 C0004096 C1306232 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C1096775 C1320102 C0418981 C2069680 C0542560 C3844652 C3172260 C1524004 C1555472 C0018792 C0578554 C0243161 C1555709 C1948032 C0040128 C0030517 C0154164 C0162044 C0455487 C0040156 C0342134 C0455485 C0018799 C2186266 C0018810 C0488794 C2041121 C2197023 C0488849 C0488855 ", "concepts": "treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Thyroids, Thyroid, Asthma summary, summary supplementation, Fat supplementation, DTS supplementation, Viscosupplementation, Iron supplementation, thyroids, thyroid, thyroid, thyroidin, Euthyroid, study, set, explorer asthma exacerbation, Clinical health care, admitted, Admitted, study, severed, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate Asthma clinical trial, placebo, study, blind, controllers, Controlled admissions, Admission, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, l thyroxine, L-thyroxine, Thyroxine, Thyroxine, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient admissions, Admission, placebo, study bronchodilator therapy, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, oxygen, oxygen, given, Uninformed PEF (peak expiratory flow), peak expiratory flow rate, Peak expiratory flow rate, primary endpoint, given normal description, prescription, prescription admitted, Admitted, Medicine, x_Medicine, study intensive care, Medicine, x_Medicine Health Care, Asthma, severed, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate, Severity criteria, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory, Clinical respiratory rates, Respiratory rate, low respiratory rate, Respiratory ratio, O/E -
