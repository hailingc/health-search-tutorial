Therefore, the investigators test out the new self warming ReadyHeat\u00ae blanket\n      device against the currently used cotton wool blanket in terms of effects on the prevention\n      and treatment of hypothermia.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Hypothermia is a common problem in traumatized patients leading to severe complications such\n      as impaired coagulation, increased rate of wound infections and overall patient discomfort\n      among others. Therefore, the investigators test out the new self warming (via an exothermic\n      reaction) ReadyHeat\u00ae blanket device against the currently used cotton wool blanket in terms\n      of effects on the prevention and treatment of hypothermia. Near body core temperature is\n      measured by a sublingual sensor as the \"gold standard\" of body core temperature measurement\n      - the pulmonary artery catheter - is too invasive and not suited for this collective of\n      patients in the emergency room setting. Blanket use will be randomized. Temperature will be\n      taken at emergency room admission, after 15, 30 and 45 minutes of treatment as well as right\n      before handing the patient over to the next caring unit (ICU, IMC, operating theatre etc.).\n      If treatment time is shorter than expected measurement will stop at the latest possible\n      point. Blankets will be applied to the patient once admission in the emergency room is\n      complete and will only be lifted for interventions.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n        - Trauma patients \u2265 18 years of all severity stages including poly traumatized patients\n        admissioned through the emergency room\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients < 18 years\n          -  Patients after pre-hospital cardiac arrest or ongoing CPR at time of admission\n", "cuis": "C0020672 C0020673 C0413252 C1963170 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0043251 C3263723 C3714660 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0020672 C0020673 C0413252 C1963170 C0033213 C2081614 C3245511 C1306232 C0043241 C0441509 C1328723 C0005790 C0427579 C1561952 C2364135 C0234215 C2065082 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C0392366 C0456984 C1551994 C1578513 C0206156 C0199176 C0020672 C0413252 C0020673 C1963170 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0020672 C0020673 C0413252 C1963170 C0033213 C2081614 C3245511 C1306232 C0043241 C0441509 C1328723 C0005790 C0427579 C1561952 C2364135 C0234215 C2065082 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C0392366 C0456984 C1551994 C1578513 C0206156 C0000828 C0456240 C0020672 C0413252 C0020673 C1963170 C0199176 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0456240 C0558302 C0018026 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C0179790 C1827218 C0007438 C1334278 C0886414 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C3887804 C0583237 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0886384 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0876906 C0015726 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C4055646 C1517001 C0184666 C0809949 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C1298903 C0886296 C1948041 C1273869 C2979881 C2183254 C1815293 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0043251 C3263723 C3714660 C1300072 C2983285 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0184666 C0243161 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0018790 C1410098 C3841758 C0184666 C0809949 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 ", "concepts": "hypothermia, Hypothermia, hypothermia, Hypothermia, Emergency, Emergency, emergency, emergency, Emergency OB, Traumas, Trauma, Trauma, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, hypothermia, Hypothermia, hypothermia, Hypothermia, problem, problem:, common, severed wound infections, Coagulation, coagulation, Coagulation, Coagulation, Coagulation, discomforts, Discomfort, coveralls, CK increased, LH increased, PT increased, QT increased, pH increased, GH increased, increased mg, CI increased, Na increased, K+ increased, Zn increased, T4 increased, T3 increased test, test, self, new, Rewarming prevention hypothermic, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment description, prescription, prescription Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, hypothermia, Hypothermia, hypothermia, Hypothermia, problem, problem:, common, severed wound infections, Coagulation, coagulation, Coagulation, Coagulation, Coagulation, discomforts, Discomfort, coveralls, CK increased, LH increased, PT increased, QT increased, pH increased, GH increased, increased mg, CI increased, Na increased, K+ increased, Zn increased, T4 increased, T3 increased test, test, self, new, Rewarming Abreaction body core temperature, hypothermic, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, prevention, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment body core temperature, sublingual, gold, standards, Standard, Standard, ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement pulmonary artery catheter, Pulmonary artery catheter care, pulmonary artery catheterization, Invasive Temperature, emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, upsetting emergency room admission, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, 5 minutes, Fright, Bright, wright, Wright theatre, scaring Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement, Unexpected, Expected admissions, Admission, emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, Device applied to patient intervention, Intervention, Intervention, Interventions, interventional, Complete criteria, Eligibility Criteria Traumas, Trauma, Trauma, stage, Severity emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, admission Criteria Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient cardiac arrest, NB cardiac arrest, Yes, cardiac arrest, admissions, Admission, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient "}
