{"text": "TITLE:\n      Evaluating the Link Between Neighborhood Environments and Obesity Among African American Women\nSUMMARY:\n      African American women have higher rates of obesity than women of any other racial or ethnic\n      group in the United States. Obesity can have many causes, including genetic and\n      environmental factors. This study will examine how neighborhood environments influence the\n      occurrence of obesity among African American women.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Obesity, which leads to higher rates of diabetes, cancer, and heart disease, is an\n      increasingly important public health problem. In 2000, over 78% of African American women\n      were overweight, and over 50% were obese. Several factors can contribute to obesity,\n      including genetics, diet, and environmental factors. Individuals who live in an environment\n      in which it is difficult to maintain an active lifestyle are more prone to obesity. The\n      Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) is an extensive long-term study that is gathering data\n      from women across the country to examine the occurrence of various diseases among African\n      American women. Using BWHS study data and specific information on participants'\n      neighborhoods, including street layout and the presence of sidewalks, this study will\n      determine if neighborhood environments influence the prevalence of obesity among African\n      American women.\n      This study will use already-collected data on physical activity and body mass index of BWHS\n      study participants who live in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago; there are no additional\n      study visits specifically for this study. A transportation and urban planning expert will\n      compile data regarding the pedestrian environment of neighborhoods in all three cities,\n      including the nature and density of land use, proximity to parks, presence of sidewalks,\n      speed and volume of traffic, and street structure. Census data regarding participants'\n      socioeconomic status will also be collected.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Participating in the BWHS study\n          -  Residing in New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago\n", "cuis": "C0028754 C1963185 C0208973 C1517892 C1704666 C2097317 C1552616 C1706244 C0028754 C0680174 C0729829 C2097317 C0028754 C1963185 C1948182 C1552839 C0947630 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0028754 C2097317 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0018799 C2186266 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0028754 C1963185 C0006826 C0260515 C0181586 C0729829 C2239238 C3244304 C0699943 C1553687 C0033213 C2081614 C2097317 C0497406 C0028754 C1948182 C0012159 C1549512 C0028754 C1299586 C1320102 C0721534 C0947630 C3245479 C1328956 C2718080 C0012634 C1550710 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C1552740 C0947630 C3245479 C3242430 C1561528 C0392148 C0947630 C0028754 C0005893 C1305855 C0231255 C0231254 C0947630 C3245479 C0178520 C0947630 C2239248 C1830410 C0032074 C0947630 C0724128 C1569289 C1512346 C3245479 C0392148 C3245479 C1285092 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0947630 ", "concepts": "Obesity, Obesity, Link, Link, Link, American elm summary, summary obesity, ethnic, urates, American elm Obesity, Obesity, genetics, groups study, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined obesity, American elm description, prescription, prescription heart disease, FHx heart disease, Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes, Obesity, Obesity, cancers, cancer, leads, urates public health, public health, Public health, public healthcare, problem, problem:, American elm overweight, obese genetics, diet, diet obesity, difficulty, Factive, Maintain study, data, eHealth, mHealth diseases, country, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined specific, study, data, informational, Information presence, study obesity Body mass index, Body mass index, low body mass index, body mass index high, study, data, body physical activity study Transportation, Transportation, planning, study, urban, Curban, visit data presence data, Gland structure criteria, Eligibility Criteria study "}
