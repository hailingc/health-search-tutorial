{"text": "TITLE:\n      Central Hypothyroidism and Cardiovascular Risk\nSUMMARY:\n      Retrospective trial of 300 patients with pituitary insufficiency treated in Department of\n      Medica Endocrinology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University concerning levothyroxine (T4)\n      replacement and cardiovascular risk factors. The hypothesis is that subtle central\n      hypothyroidism is associated with adverse cardiac risk factors, such as body composition and\n      serum lipids, and that improved T4 replacement will eliminate this increased risk,\n      independently of other pituitary hormone replacements.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Retrospective trial of 300 patients with pituitary insufficiency treated in Department of\n      Medical Endocrinology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University concerning levothyroxine (T4)\n      replacement and cardiovascular risk profile. The patient files are recruited among\n      hypopituitary patients treated with growth hormone from the period 1993 to 2008. The trial\n      is a retrospective assessment of data already collected for routine purposes and thus an\n      audit of daily clinical practice. All information on the patients is obtained from the paper\n      and electronic files existing in the department and no new measurements are foreseen.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  All patients with pituitary hypopituitarism\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Unavailability of data\n", "cuis": "C0271801 C3831153 C3887460 C0007220 C1552616 C1706244 C0020635 C0018792 C0332155 C0040165 C1881373 C0445466 C0199168 C1561579 C3887460 C0007220 C0436125 C0497234 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C2024776 C0020676 C0455486 C0486616 C1555710 C0152338 C0428462 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C1561611 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C0282402 C0032005 C0032002 C1299583 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0020635 C0018792 C0332155 C0040165 C1881373 C0199168 C1561579 C0445466 C3887460 C0007220 C0436125 C0497234 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C0037663 C0169964 C0202056 C0025344 C0018792 C0020635 C0332155 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C3245479 C0237607 C3245512 C3242430 C1561528 C3272565 C1578513 C0423103 C2048307 C3838520 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0020635 C0242343 C0032005 C0032002 C0243161 C3245479 ", "concepts": "Central Hypothyroidism, Central Hyperthyroidism, Cardiovascular, Cardiovascular drug summary, summary pituitary insufficiency, Atrial, untreated levothyroxine, Levothyroxine, Copenhageni, Medical, Medical cardiovascular, cardiovascular drug, cardiovascular exam, Pain;cardiovascular, risk factors, risk factors, No risk factors, A/N risk factors, replacements, Replacement, placement cardiac risk factors, hypothyroidism, H/O: hypothyroidism, compositions, composition, body serum lipids, replacements, Replacement, placement, Improved, CK increased, LH increased, PT increased, QT increased, pH increased, GH increased, increased mg, CI increased, Na increased, K+ increased, Zn increased, T4 increased, T3 increased hormone replacements, Pituitary, Pituitary, independent description, prescription, prescription pituitary insufficiency, Atrial, untreated levothyroxine, Levothyroxine, Medical, Medical, Copenhageni cardiovascular, cardiovascular drug, cardiovascular exam, Pain;cardiovascular, replacements, Replacement, placement growth hormones, Growth hormone, Growth hormone, period, Atrial, hypopituitarism, untreated Assessment, assessments, Assessment, Assessment, IQ assessment, data practices, practice, informational, Information, Clinical new, Eye measurements, ICD measurements, arm measurements criteria, Eligibility Criteria hypopituitarism, Panhypopituitarism, Pituitary, Pituitary Criteria data "}
