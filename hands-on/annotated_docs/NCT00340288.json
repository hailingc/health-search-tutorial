{"text": "TITLE:\n      Fibroid Growth Study\nSUMMARY:\n      Uterine leiomyomas, commonly called fibroids, are a major health concern for women of\n      reproductive age. The objectives of the study described herein are to investigate the growth\n      dynamics of uterine leiomyomas in a clinically relevant population of women. We will test\n      the hypotheses that uterine leiomyomas are heterogeneous in terms of their growth\n      characteristics and in their clinical symptoms or outcomes, and that differences in\n      leiomyoma growth dynamics can be discriminated by molecular markers and cellular phenotypes.\n      Participants will include 300 premenopausal women (greater than 18 years old) with at least\n      one uterine leiomyoma. The inclusion criteria for patient enrollment is confirmed diagnosis\n      of leiomyoma by ultrasound. At least one leiomyoma must be equal to or greater than 2 cm in\n      diameter and the uterus must be enlarged to the size typical during the eigth week of\n      pregnancy. After enrollment and informed consent, T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance\n      image (MRI) scans will be conducted beginning at the first visit and then at 3, 6, and 12\n      months. Each patient will have a physical exam, provide urine and blood samples at each MRI\n      visit, and respond to an initial extensive telephone-administered questionnaire followed by\n      abbreviated monthly questionnaire updates. A number of the enrolled women will require\n      surgical intervention (hysterectomy/myomectomy) as standard care. If surgery is an outcome\n      for women enrolled in the study, MRI will be conducted before surgery and the surgical\n      pathologist will map uterine leiomyomas for comparison to MRI. Leiomyoma samples will be\n      analyzed for histopathological and molecular changes correlated with growth. Because\n      hysterectomy and myomectomy are common outcomes in women with leiomyomas, we anticipate\n      tissue will be available from at least 100 of the 300 women in the study. For those women\n      who opt for surgery, we will also administer a brief (less than 5 minute) questionnaire\n      clarifying their reason for electing surgery. Upon completion of data collection, we will be\n      able to compare leiomyoma growth as a function of multiplicity and location; examine the\n      relationship between leiomyoma growth and clinical symptoms or outcome; identify molecular,\n      cellular, and pathological characteristics of leiomyomas with differing growth dynamics; and\n      examine endocrinological parameters and lifestyle factors related to differential growth\n      dynamics of uterine leiomyomas. The data may be used to establish a clinical severity scale\n      and establish diagnostic markers currently not available for uterine leiomyomas.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Uterine leiomyomas, commonly called fibroids, are a major health concern for women of\n      reproductive age.

Upon completion of data collection, we will be\n      able to compare leiomyoma growth as a function of multiplicity and location; examine the\n      relationship between leiomyoma growth and clinical symptoms or outcome; identify molecular,\n      cellular, and pathological characteristics of leiomyomas with differing growth dynamics; and\n      examine endocrinological parameters and lifestyle factors related to differential growth\n      dynamics of uterine leiomyomas. The data may be used to establish a clinical severity scale\n      and establish diagnostic markers currently not available for uterine leiomyomas.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n        Women included in the study must be at least 18 years if age, premenopausal, speak\n        English, and have one or more uterine leiomyomas at least 2 cm in diameter and the utuerus\n        must be enlarged to the size typical during the 8th week of pregnancy. Note that while the\n        selcetion criteia are set to recruit women in which surgical intervention is a likely\n        outcome, surgery is not a requirement for study inclusion.\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n        Women will be excluded if they are pregnant because of potential safety concerns\n        associated with imaging and image contrast enhancements. If women become pregnant during\n        the study, they wil have the option to stay in the study, but will have pelvic ultrasound\n        scans in place of MRI scans.\n        Women who are taking or likely to start taking GnRH therapy will be excluded because this\n        therapy, which is used as a treatment method for leiomyomas, sometmes induces their\n        regression.\n        Women who are greater than 52 inches in circumference or greater than 350 pounds will be\n        excluded because they will be too large to fit in the imaging equipment.\n        Women that have an intra-uterine device (IUD) will be excluded because these metal devices\n        create 'shadowing' in MR images, making accurate measurement and interpretation of\n        leiomyomas in the MRIs difficult.\n        Women are not excluded if they had a prior myomectomy, or if they are taking oral\n        contraceptives.\n        The inclusion of only women of premenopausal age (greater than 18 years old) in this study\n        is dictated by the nature of the condition.\n", "cuis": "C0023267 C0042133 C0018270 C0947630 C1552616 C1706244 C0023267 C0042133 C0042149 C3869780 C0035150
