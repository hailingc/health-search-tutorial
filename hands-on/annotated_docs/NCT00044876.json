{"text": "TITLE:\n      Treatment of Uterine Fibroids With CDB-2914, an Experimental Selective Progesterone Receptor Antagonist\nSUMMARY:\n      Uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) are a common benign tumor of the uterine muscle in\n      premenopausal women. These tumors may cause bleeding, pelvic pain and pressure. Because\n      fibroids grow in the presence of estrogen, medical therapies that decrease estrogen levels\n      (like GnRH analog) cause fibroids to shrink and so may relieve symptoms. However, such\n      medication can only be given short-term and has inconvenient side effects such as\n      hot-flushes. Thus, many women with symptomatic fibroids choose to have them removed\n      surgically, either individually or by removing the uterus via hysterectomy.\n      The study evaluates a new medical treatment for fibroids using the progesterone receptor\n      modulator CDB-2914. A similar compound, mifepristone (Registered Trademark), reduced fibroid\n      size when given for twelve weeks. This study will compare fibroid size, hormone levels and\n      symptoms before and during daily administration of CDB-2914 (10 or 25 mg) or placebo for 10\n      - 14 weeks. To do this, women will undergo MRI and a saline hysterosonogram (ultrasound with\n      fluid) of the uterus before and at the end of the treatment; they will have blood drawn\n      every 7 - 14 days, and will fill out a symptom calendar at home. Hysterectomy will be\n      performed at the end of the treatment to evaluate the effects of the medication on the\n      uterine and fibroid tissues, and to provide treatment for the study participant. Women will\n      be randomly assigned to the treatment groups; during the treatment period neither the\n      participants nor the investigators will know the type of treatment that a woman receives.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) are a common benign tumor of the uterine muscle in\n      premenopausal women.
