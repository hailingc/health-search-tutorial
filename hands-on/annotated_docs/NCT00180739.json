Women age < 46 years old who plan to\n             have egg donation. Women above 38 should test for normal ovarian function as judged\n             by endocrinological evaluation.\n        If the couple has failed to conceive for more that 1 year, the woman should test for\n        normal ovarian function as judged by endocrinological evaluation, and the male must have\n        adequate sperm test.\n        Women undergoing fertility treatment or plan to have sperm donation.\n          -  2.
