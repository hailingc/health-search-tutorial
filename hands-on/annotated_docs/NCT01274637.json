{"text": "TITLE:\n      PROSPER: PostpaRtum PrOphylaxiS for PE Randomized Control Trial Pilot\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is feasible to conduct a multi-center\n      randomized trial to determine whether a blood thinner, low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH),\n      is effective at preventing blood clots, thromboembolism (VTE), in postpartum women at risk.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The PROPSER pilot is a randomized, open-label pilot study comparing prophylactic low\n      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to saline placebo. The PROSPER pilot study will assess the\n      feasibility of conducting a full trial as measured by the number of subjects recruited per\n      center per month. In addition, clinical data will be collected to determine an estimate of\n      the primary outcome event rate (symptomatic VTE or asymptomatic proximal deep vein\n      thrombosis (DVT) and major bleeding event rate for the full trial in LMWH and control\n      groups. If our pilot results indicate that no substantial changes are needed to the study\n      design, we will include the pilot data in the primary and secondary outcome analyses for the\n      full trial (i.e. a \"Vanguard trial\" or internal pilot trial).\n      Eligible consenting women at risk of postpartum thrombosis will be randomized within 36\n      hours after delivery of the placenta and will be equally allocated to 2 trial arms, either\n      the treatment group: prophylactic-dose LMWH, subcutaneously once daily for 10 days (+/-3\n      days), or the control group.\n      At 10 days (+/- 3 days), all women will have a study visit to assess for study outcomes,\n      including bilateral leg ultrasound screening for VTE and a D-dimer test. A final telephone\n      follow-up will occur at 90 days for outcome assessment of subsequent VTE, bleeding or other\n      adverse events.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n        Women must be at high risk for thromboembolism for one of the following reasons:\n          1. Known low risk thrombophilia (Known = diagnosed prior to enrollment and low risk\n             thrombophilia includes heterozygous factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene variant or\n             protein C deficiency or protein S deficiency. If not previously tested then assumed\n             not to have thrombophilia).\n          2. Immobilization (defined as >90% of waking hours in bed, of a week or more at any\n             point in the antepartum period).\n        OR any two of the following reasons:\n          1. Postpartum infection (fever (temperature>38.5oC) and clinical signs/symptoms of\n             infection and elevated neutrophil count (higher than local lab normal))\n          2.
