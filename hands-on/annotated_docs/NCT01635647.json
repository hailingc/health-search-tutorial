{"text": "TITLE:\n      A Phase 1/2b Study of an Investigational Malaria Vaccination Strategy in 5-17 Month Old Infants and Children in Burkina Faso\nSUMMARY:\n      Prime boost vaccination with ChAd63 ME-TRAP followed eight weeks later with MVA ME-TRAP\n      shows efficacy against malaria infection when tested in UK volunteers using sporozoite\n      challenge experiments. It is a leading candidate vaccination strategy against malaria. In\n      the field, Phase I studies have been conducted in adults in Kenya and The Gambia and\n      children and infants in The Gambia. The vaccination strategy appears safe and well tolerated\n      in these populations, and also shows impressive immunogenicity, not significantly different\n      to that seen in the UK trials where efficacy was shown. In particular, recent data from The\n      Gambia shows excellent safety and immunogenicity in infants in malaria endemic areas, who\n      would be the ones to benefit most from such a vaccine against malaria. With this clinical\n      development as background, the investigators now propose to evaluate efficacy against\n      natural malaria infection in this important target group for an effective malaria vaccine,\n      that is, 5-17 month infants and children living in malaria endemic areas. The proposed study\n      area, Banfora, Burkina Faso, is highly endemic for Plasmodium falciparum malaria.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          1. Healthy infant/child aged 5-17 months at the time of first study vaccination\n          2. Informed consent of parent/guardian\n          3. Infant / child and parent/guardian resident in the study area villages and\n             anticipated to be available for vaccination and follow-up\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Clinically significant skin disorder (psoriasis, contact dermatitis etc.),\n             immunodeficiency, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, endocrine disorder,\n             liver disease, renal disease, gastrointestinal disease, neurological illness.\n          -  Weight-for-age Z score of less than -3 or other clinical signs of malnutrition\n          -  History of allergic reaction, significant IgE-mediated event, or anaphylaxis to\n             immunisation\n          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of\n             the vaccines, e.g. egg products, Kathon, neomycin, beta-propiolactone.\n          -  Haemoglobin less than 8.0 g/dL, where judged to be clinically significant in the\n             opinion of the investigator\n          -  Serum Creatinine concentration greater than 70 \u00b5mol/L, where judged to be clinically\n             significant in the opinion of the investigator\n          -  Serum ALT concentration greater than 45 U/L, where judged to be clinically\n             significant in the opinion of the investigator\n          -  Blood transfusion within one month of enrolment\n          -  Previous vaccination with experimental malaria vaccines.\n          -  Administration of any other vaccine or immunoglobulin less than one week before\n             vaccination with any study vaccine.\n          -  Current participation in another clinical trial, or within 12 weeks of this study.\n          -  Any other finding which in the opinion of the investigators would increase the risk\n             of an adverse outcome from participation in the trial or result in incomplete or poor\n             quality data\n          -  Known maternal HIV infection (No testing will be done by the study team)\n          -  Immunosuppressive therapy (steroids, immune modulators or immune suppressors) within\n             3 months prior recruitment. (For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone, or\n             equivalent, greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids are\n             allowed.)\n", "cuis": "C0042196 C1114735 C0024530 C3541306 C0947630 C0450314 C3245491 C0220825 C1261322 C0013230 C1552578 C0679199 C3179957 C1552616 C1706244 C0042196 C2713304 C0058773 C0419749 C0184047 C0009450 C3714514 C0275524 C0012683 C0035637 C0276041 C0729555 C0747002 C0024530 C0206255 C1744563 C0392366 C0228018 C0042196 C2713304 C0058773 C0419749 C0805586 C2347900 C2348080 C0798503 C0679199 C0024530 C0206255 C1744563 C0947630 C1553496 C0444990 C0042196 C2713304 C0058773 C0419749 C0679199 C1273937 C3245479 C0024530 C0206255 C1744563 C0042210 C0024530 C0206255 C1744563 C3272565 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0220825 C0206255 C0009450 C3714514 C0275524 C0012683 C0035637 C0276041 C0729555 C0747002 C0024530 C1744563 C1552839 C0553288 C0024530 C0206255 C1744563 C1561542 C0947630 C0024535 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0042196 C2713304 C0058773 C0419749 C0947630 C1561542 C0947630 C1549439 C3835651 C0042196 C2713304 C0058773 C0419749 C3840775 C0243161 C0011616 C0406261 C0406271 C0162824 C0452157 C0263238 C0406272 C0037274 C0033860 C1815389 C3272565 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0558373 C0849932 C0264656 C0042373 C0035204 C0035242 C0455540 C0264219 C0264221 C1290325 C0455409 C0014130 C0455484 C0553665 C1285294 C0021051 C1855166 C0043194 C0221026 C0549463 C1279481 C3714976 C0017178 C0455553 C0455420 C0021831 C0857590 C2186518 C0023895 C2186532 C3280432 C0455417 C0022658 C0001621 C1857414 C0162429 C0392209 C1442959 C0944911 C1305866 C3812400 C3272565 C0020517 C1527304 C0013182 C0863090 C1171179 C0413234 C3662262 C0002792 C0850803 C0262926 C2004062 C0202086 C0127400 C0020971 C0042196 C0302020 C0848563 C0042200 C0199804 C0199808 C0199810 C0849707 C0850113 C0948201 C1656594 C0436331 C0262926 C2004062 C0012634 C0018609 C0000828 C0442740 C1524073 C0042210 C0027603 C0027515 C0701906 C1508746 C0518015 C0200695 C1275423 C1168037 C0948093 C0474543 C1561562 C2239101 C0871010 C0201976 C2981751 C4055609 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C0871010 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C0229671 C1546774 C1550100 C0871010 C0005841 C0179335 C0430274 C2741651 C0744963 C1561542 C0206255 C0042196 C2713304 C0058773 C0419749 C1533734 C0725057 C0376495 C3845829 C0001563 C0036589 C0455708 C1534841 C2360550 C0021027 C0020843 C0020852 C0202081 C0481219 C0085297 C0553533 C2748351 C0202083 C2825347 C0577612 C0202086 C0202087 C3536873 C0202084 C0201467 C0850992 C0042210 C1561540 C0042196 C2713304 C0058773 C0419749 C0042210 C0947630 C1096775 C0947630 C0871010 C3687374 C0018792 C3245479 C0019693 C3669463 C0276500 C0276501 C1858460 C0721591 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C0947630 C0021079 C0455630 C0005525 C2954564 C0001617 C3653466 C3539185 C3540725 C3540726 C3540727 C3536709 C0161508 C0239126 C0271510 C0032952 C0065967 C1561542 C2064827 C0004048 C1720702 C1561538 ", "concepts": "Vaccination, Vaccination AE, Malaria, Malaria, Study, 1/2b, investigational, Investigation, Investigations, Investigational Drug, investigation, strategy, Stratego summary, summary vaccination, Revaccinations, DT vaccination, vaccination dt, trap Infection, infections, Coinfections, Disinfection, RP infection, MG infection, GI infection, op infection, malarias, malaria, malari, tested, teste vaccination, Revaccinations, DT vaccination, vaccination dt, challenges, Rechallenge, Dechallenge, Challenge, strategy, malarias, malaria, malari studies, field, Kenyae vaccination, Revaccinations, DT vaccination, vaccination dt, strategy Not significant data malarias, malaria, malari vaccine, malarias, malaria, malari, Clinical development, Development, Development, Development, No development, Evaluate malaria, Infection, infections, Coinfections, Disinfection, RP infection, MG infection, GI infection, op infection, malarias, malari, groups children living, malarias, malaria, malari, month, study Plasmodium falciparum malaria criteria, Eligibility Criteria vaccination, Revaccinations, DT vaccination, vaccination dt, study, month study, Resident, Resident vaccination, Revaccinations, DT vaccination, vaccination dt, Anticipated Criteria Contact dermatitis NOS, Oil contact dermatitis, Egg contact dermatitis, photocontact dermatitis, Photocontact dermatitis, Acute contact dermatitis, plant contact dermatitis, skin disorder, psoriasis, psoriasin, Clinical CVD -
