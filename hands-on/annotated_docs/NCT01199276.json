{"text": "TITLE:\n      Hip Fracture Surgery in Elderly Patients\nSUMMARY:\n      The objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of Post-Operative Delirium (POD),\n      diagnosed with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), in elderly patients undergoing hip\n      fracture surgery under general anaesthesia with xenon or sevoflurane, for a period of four\n      days post-surgery.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Elderly patient (\u2265 75 years)\n          -  Patient with planned hip fracture surgery within 48 hours after the hip fracture\n          -  Patient willing and able to complete the requirements of this study including the\n             signature of the written informed consent\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patient suffering from multiple fractures, pelvic fractures proximal, pathological\n             fractures, femur fractures (i.e., fractures of the middle or distal femur)\n          -  Disabling neuropsychiatric disorders (severe dementia, Alzheimer's disease,\n             schizophrenia, depression)\n          -  Brain trauma within 12 months prior to selection, history of stroke with residuals\n          -  Patient suffering from delirium (CAM diagnosis) at selection\n          -  Patient who cannot complete the pre-operative mental tests (CAM and/or MMSE) of this\n             clinical trial\n          -  Patient with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score < 24 at selection\n          -  Patient known to susceptible to malignant hyperthermia\n          -  Patient with elevated intra-cranial pressure\n          -  Patient with a risk of high oxygen demand\n          -  Patient with recent or ongoing myocardial infarction / damage\n          -  Patient with severe cardiac failure, or patient with severe impaired left ventricular\n             systolic function\n          -  Patient with known severe lung and/or airway disease, or severe chronic respiratory\n             insufficiency, or a sustained homecare oxygen therapy\n          -  Contra-indication (serious illness or medical conditions) for general anaesthesia\n          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any drugs administered during this clinical\n             trial\n          -  Previous participation in this clinical trial\n          -  Participation in another clinical trial within 4 weeks prior to selection\n          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric disorders which would impair the\n             understanding of the necessary information or render medically or legally unable to\n             give written informed consent\n", "cuis": "C0019557 C0149531 C0543467 C1705196 C3842534 C3842535 C3842536 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838
