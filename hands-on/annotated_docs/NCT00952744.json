{"text": "TITLE:\n      Investigation of the Biomarker Copeptin in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction\nSUMMARY:\n      While troponin is not detectable until several hours after an Acute Myocardial Infarction\n      (AMI), copeptin is expected to be elevated very early after an AMI. A combination of both\n      markers for the diagnosis of AMI early after the event is therefore expected to be\n      advantageous.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      In patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) such as chest pain or\n      pressure, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and nausea, detection of a rise and/or fall of\n      troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit is\n      essential to the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, current troponin\n      testing has limitations, including antibody specificity, assay imprecision, lack of\n      standardization and a relatively late increase in the circulating troponin level after the\n      onset of ischemia. Studies have shown a low diagnostic sensitivity of troponins when\n      measured early (<6 hours) after symptom onset. Although there are some more sensitive\n      troponin assays with a coefficient of variation (CV)10% at the 99th percentile of a normal\n      reference population, most troponin assays have an imprecision CV of around 20% at the 99th\n      percentile of the reference population. The early insensitivity of troponin results in an\n      unmet need in the clinical evaluation of patients presenting with suspected ACS and AMI.\n      Copeptin may improve early AMI diagnostic sensitivity because of a number of unique\n      characteristics.\n        -  Copeptin levels are elevated at presentation in patients with AMI compared to patients\n           with other presentations.\n        -  Copeptin levels are elevated in patients with AMI even when troponin levels were not\n           elevated at the time of initial presentation.\n        -  Thus, a combination of troponin and copeptin levels at presentation may result in a\n           more accurate diagnosis of acute AMI than troponin alone.\n        -  Copeptin levels drop 1 day after an AMI.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  The subject must be 18 years of age or older.\n          -  The subject must present to the Emergency Department with symptoms consistent with\n             acute coronary syndromes (e.g., chest discomfort/pain, squeezing/fullness in the\n             chest, pain radiating to left or both arms, jaw pain, pain in the back/neck/stomach,\n             shortness of breath, cold sweat, nausea/vomiting, lightheadedness).\n          -  The subject must present to the Emergency Department within 6 hours of the onset of\n             the most recent symptoms that prompted the subject to seek medical attention in the\n             Emergency Department.\n          -  The patient agrees to abide by all aspects of the protocol, including all telephone\n             follow-up.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  The patient is unable to provide consent or understand the consent form.\n          -  The ACS symptoms are clearly not the result of ACS (i.e., penetrating wounds, crush\n             injury, etc.)\n", "cuis": "C0155626 C3541950 C0027051 C0428953 C3810814 C0155668 C3640911 C0220825 C1261322 C1552578 C3245491 C0005516 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0155626 C3541950 C0027051 C0428953 C3810814 C0155668 C3640911 C3827727 C3830527 C1141947 C0523952 C3539181 C3539182 C3539954 C3539955 C3539956 C3539957 C3539959 C3539960 C3539961 C3539962 C3539963 C3539964 C3539965 C3539966 C3539967 C3539968 C3539969 C3539970 C3539971 C3539972 C3539973 C3539974 C3539975 C3539976 C3539977 C3539978 C3539979 C3540026 C3540027 C3540028 C3540030 C3540031 C3540719 C3540720 C3540721 C3540722 C3540723 C3540724 C3540740 C3854036 C3811910 C0052142 C0251244 C0965970 C0056279 C4055646 C1517001 C0856882 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0005516 C4055646 C1517001 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0948089 C0008031 C2926613 C1457887 C0013404 C2707305 C4054349 C0748649 C0700590 C0003028 C0460139 C0027497 C0085639 C1511790 C1514811 C1561577 C1141947 C0523952 C0155626 C0340294 C0582803 C0264708 C0027051 C2063313 C1735640 C0340311 C0155668 C0428953 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C1141947 C0523952 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C1510438 C0021027 C0201278 C0861135 C0860947 C1141947 C0523952 C0022116 C1550472 C0237677 C0020517 C0312418 C0427965 C0011900 C0358514 C0430022 C1547424 C1457887 C0020517 C1553386 C1141947 C0523952 C1510438 C3176770 C1514811 C1561577 C1141947 C0523952 C1510438 C0237677 C1514811 C1561577 C1141947 C0523952 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C3272565 C4061640 C0237677 C0020517 C0312418 C0427965 C0011900 C0358514 C0430022 C1547424 C0022396 C0423864 C0233256 C1389312 C0856882 C0233256 C0856882 C1141947 C0523952 C0233256 C1389312 C0856882 C3539181 C3539182 C3539954 C3539955 C3539956 C3539957 C3539959 C3539960 C3539961 C3539962 C3539963 C3539964 C3539965 C3539966 C3539967 C3539968 C3539969 C3539970 C3539971 C3539972 C3539973 C3539974 C3539975 C3539976 C3539977 C3539978 C3539979 C3540026 C3540027 C3540028 C3540030 C3540031 C3540719 C3540720 C3540721 C3540722 C3540723 C3540724 C3540740 C3854036 C3811910 C0052142 C0251244 C0965970 C0056279 C0233256 C1389312 C1141947 C0523952 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C1141947 C0523952 C1561538 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1555709 C1948032 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C1457887 C0948089 C0235710 C0030193 C0541911 C0234254 C0850629 C1960989 C0236000 C2015951 C0038351 C0817096 C0446516 C0030193 C0027530 C2137077 C0013404 C2707305 C4054349 C0748649 C0027498 C0220870 C0012833 C0232431 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0004268 C0424101 C1457887 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0040399 C1576871 C1626258 C3273808 C0243161 C0009797 C0162340 C1299582 C1555587 C0043254 C1457887 C0185060 C3263723 ", "concepts": "Acute Myocardial Infarction, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Myocardial Infarctions, Myocardial Infarction, Myocardial Infarction, Old Myocardial Infarction, New Myocardial Infarction, Investigation, Investigation NOS, investigation, investigational, Biomarker, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary Acute Myocardial Infarction, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Myocardial Infarctions, Myocardial Infarction, Myocardial Infarction, Old Myocardial Infarction, New Myocardial Infarction, Undetectable, Detectable, t troponin, Troponin combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, Combination, AP combination, MP combination, ET combination, copeptins, Unexpected, Expected, elevated k diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, marker, Unexpected, Expected description, prescription, prescription acute coronary syndrome, chest pain, Chest pain, symptoms shortness of breath (SOB), Shortness of breath, No shortness of breath, shortness of breath rest, diaphoresis, Adiaphoresis, pressure, nausea, fall, Detection reference, Reference, t troponin, Troponin AMI -
