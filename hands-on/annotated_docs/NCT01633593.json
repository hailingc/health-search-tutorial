{"text": "TITLE:\n      Treatment of Delirium in the Elderly With Donepezil: a Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Clinical Trial\nSUMMARY:\n      Nowadays features for the diagnosis of delirium are:\n        1. Disturbance of consciousness (i.e. reduced clarity of environment awareness) with\n           reduced ability to focus, sustain or shift attention;\n        2. A change in cognition (such as memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance) or\n           the development of a perceptual disturbance that is not better accounted for by a\n           pre-existing or evolving dementia;\n        3. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to days) and its\n           severity fluctuates during the course of the day;\n        4. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that\n           the disorder is caused by the direct physiological consequences of a general medical\n           condition, substance intoxication or substance withdrawal.\n      Treatment of underlying clinical disease is important to remit the delirium. However, these\n      procedures alone are not enough to remit the delirium early and to prevent sequels. There is\n      a need for a specific and faster strategy to treat the delirium.\n      The investigators want to test the hypothesis that an Anticholinesterase Inhibitor\n      (donepezil) can reduce the duration of the delirium.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Over 60 year old\n          -  Delirium according to the CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care\n             Unit)\n          -  informed consent (legal representatives)\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  unable to swallow pills\n          -  previous allergy to donepezil\n          -  Atrioventricular block of 2nd and 3nd degree\n", "cuis": "C1096775 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0527316 C0011206 C0032042 C0456909 C0180112 C2911690 C3897779 C1552616 C1706244 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0011206 C0234428 C0004448 C0041657 C0589402 C0486588 C0004268 C0424101 C0233794 C0009676 C0233407 C0029266 C0009240 C0524637 C0679015 C0033348 C2706915 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0233746 C2981730 C0011265 C0497327 C0425946 C1561538 C2983285 C0031809 C0944752 C0946068 C2973270 C1444322 C1444324 C0587081 C0587095 C0586624 C0586721 C0262926 C2004062 C1328018 C0012634 C3244286 C2957290 C0728899 C0268021 C0236729 C0260146 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C2825032 C3812880 C4049634 C0075414 C0612235 C0075371 C0253996 C0630206 C0914164 C0916881 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0011206 C0012634 C0018609 C3272565 C0025664 C0184661 C0011206 C0243089 C1328018 C1552740 C0679199 C0011206 C0008425 C3540712 C0392366 C0456984 C1446194 C0527316 C0011206 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1561543 C0085559 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1261322 C2826217 C0009676 C0683369 C1963086 C2712099 C0011206 C0025663 C2827714 C2828387 C2347274 C0009797 C0973449 C0243161 C4048182 C2712086 C0527316 C0020517 C0489531 C1527304 C0719113 C0719656 C3247823 C0004245 C2215934 C2882257 C0542560 ", "concepts": "Clinical Trial, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Donepezil, Delirium, Placebo, blind, controllers, Controlled, Randomiz summary, summary diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, delirium Disturbance of consciousness, awareness, unawareness, unawareness, clarity attention, Inattention memory deficit, Disorientation, Disorientation, orientation, cognition, Recognition, Precognition, Language, Language development, Development, Development, Development, No development, perceptual disturbances, account dementia, dementia short period day, Severity rnrx physical examination, Eye physical examination, Eye physical examination, Annual physical examination, Assess physical examination, Manage physical examination, laboratory findings, Laboratory findings NAD, laboratory findings normal, Raised laboratory findings, history, history, Therex disorder, direct, general medical care intoxication, K intoxication, PCP intoxication, Autointoxication, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, Withdrawal, Withdrawal, Withdrawal, substance S, substance M, substance 86, GV substance, substance 30, substance S2, substance S1 treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, delirium, disease, h disease, Clinical procedures, Procedures, delirium, sequels, Therex specific, strategy, delirium anticholinesterases, Anticholinesterases, test, test, C1 Inhibitor donepezil, delirium, Induration, Duration, Duration criteria, Eligibility Criteria year Intensive Care, assessment, Assessment, Assessment, assessment, No Assessment, confusion, Confusion, Confusion, No Confusion, Delirium, Methods, Method, Method Unit informed consent form, galega Criteria unable to swallow, Able to swallow donepezil, allergy, allergy, allergy, Callergy, dallergy, Dallergy Atrioventricular block, NOS, ECG atrioventricular block, Other atrioventricular block, degree "}
