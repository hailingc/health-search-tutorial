{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effects of a Novel Dietary Intervention on Body Composition After Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Surgery\nSUMMARY:\n      We propose to compare the standard of care with the use of a novel medical food in 6\n      bariatric surgery patients by measuring outcomes of body composition, quality of life, hair\n      loss, muscle strength, resting energy expenditure, and biochemical parameters.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      STUDY SUMMARY The purpose of this pilot study is to compare a medical food intervention with\n      the dietary standard of care at Boston Medical Center, in obese women subjects undergoing\n      Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery. Commercially available nutritional supplements will also\n      be provided as part of the study's protocol.\n      Subjects will be selected from surgical candidates of the Nutrition and Weight Management\n      Center who meet the study criteria. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the 2\n      groups (treatment and control). Subjects will be seen at the study site 2 weeks before\n      surgery and 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after surgery (for a total of 5\n      visits). Data recorded during the study visits will be used to assess post-operative\n      progress and will include: body composition, resting energy expenditure, muscle strength,\n      quality of life questionnaires, hair loss, and blood markers for insulin resistance,\n      nutritional state, organ function, lipid profile and inflammation. Safety indicators and\n      compliance will also be monitored.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Obese and morbidly obese women (BMI 30 - 50)\n          -  25 years and older undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery\n          -  Present with at least either metabolic syndrome or diabetes\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Have smoked in the past 4 weeks\n          -  Pregnant\n          -  Allergic or intolerant to ingredients used in the study (e.g. soy and THIAA)\n          -  There is a sound medical, psychiatric and/or social reason as determined by the\n             Principal Investigator (PI) that makes the subject unsuitable for the study\n", "cuis": "C0086153 C0017125 C0031150 C0023036 C1883297 C0486616 C1555710 C0543467 C1705196 C3842534 C3842535 C3842536 C1551342 C1552616 C1706244 C2936643 C0679622 C3540798 C1456587 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C0486616 C1555710 C0152338 C0018494 C0014272 C0429629 C4050373 C0513883 C0449381 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C3540798 C2936643 C0199168 C1561579 C3810851 C0028754 C0017125 C0729258 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0242297 C3272563 C0680536 C0002804 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0947630 C1555587 C2958388 C0518896 C1442959 C2707262 C0392209 C0543467 C0587668 C0243161 C1552601 C3810851 C0947630 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1552839 C0947630 C0596948 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C1561542 C0947630 C1512346 C0182913 C0030201 C2112579 C0014272 C0429629 C0486616 C1555710 C0152338 C4050373 C0513883 C0021655 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C0034394 C1706422 C3836256 C3836250 C3836251 C3836252 C3836254 C3836255 C0002170 C0005768 C0229664 C0005516 C0392209 C0021368 C0007971 C0014236 C0017574 C0029877 C0854217 C0021212 C0031843 C1705273 C0178784 C0523744 C3714738 C0376405 C0030695 C0150369 C0181904 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0028754 C0017125 C0729258 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0031150 C0023036 C1883297 C0843540 C1555709 C1948032 C0524620 C1262289 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0243161 C0549206 C0947630 C2756587 C3467963 C0231199 C1744706 C1548428 C3526598 C1328018 C0947630 C3899561 C3899560 ", "concepts": "Dietary Intervention, Gastric Bypass, Laparoscopy, Laparoscope, Laparoscopy, compositions, composition, Surgery, Surgery, Surgery 3, Surgery 2, Surgery 1, Body summary, summary standard of care, novel, food bariatric surgery, Quality of life, quality of life, Poor quality of life, compositions, composition, body, hair energy expenditure, Total energy expenditure, Muscle strength, Note muscle strength, Parameters description, prescription, prescription interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, summary, summary, study, food standard of care, Medical, Medical, Center, obese gastric bypass, High gastric bypass, surgery, surgery, surgery:, Nutritional supplement, Commercial, Commercials, Roux-en-Y Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, study, provider Weight Management, Nutrition, nutrition, Nutritional, nutrition, Surgical, Surgical criteria, assigned, Center, study Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, groups, study, mind control surgery, surgery, surgery:, month study, visit, recorder, pain post-operative, post-operative care energy expenditure, Total energy expenditure, compositions, composition, body, Muscle strength, Note muscle strength insulin resistance, Quality of life, quality of life, Poor quality of life, questionnaires, Questionnaires, questionnaires ad8, questionnaires moca, questionnaires koos, questionnaires kccq, questionnaires hoos, questionnaires bomc, hair loss, blood, blood, marker nutritional state, inflammation, inflammation lip, Eye inflammation, gum inflammation, inflammation ear, Jaw inflammation, indicators, function, Function, organ, lipids Compliance, Noncompliance, monitor, monitor, monitor criteria, Eligibility Criteria obese gastric bypass, High gastric bypass, surgery, surgery, surgery:, laparoscopy, laparoscope, laparoscopy, laparoscopic BSO, folder, Folder Dysmetabolic syndrome x, Dysmetabolic syndrome, Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes Criteria Pregnant study, soy, Allergican, intolerance, intolerance Psychiatric, Psychiatric, Therex study, Principal Investigator CV, Principal Investigator License "}
