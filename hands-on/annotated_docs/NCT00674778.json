{"text": "TITLE:\n      Prospective Registry on Vascular Access in Interventions in Lazio Region\nSUMMARY:\n      Previous randomised studies showed that radial artery catheterisation for percutaneous\n      cardiovascular procedures has a superior safety profile than femoral access, however the\n      confirmation of these benefits in the real world by a large, specific, observational study\n      is still lacking.\n      We endeavoured to assess the access site-related outcomes of any percutaneous cardiovascular\n      procedure by designing a prospective registry monitoring a consecutive sample of patients in\n      a short period of time at nine Roman hospitals reflecting the contemporary state of health\n      care.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  All patients undergoing any percutaneous cardiovascular procedure\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients already enrolled in other clinical trials\n", "cuis": "C1273869 C2979881 C1948041 C0886296 C0034975 C0005847 C0042383 C0445523 C1552616 C1706244 C0007430 C0191117 C0162857 C1278948 C0947630 C0189573 C2024834 C0396664 C0849557 C2022284 C0199535 C0015811 C1611825 C1552740 C0947630 C1964257 C0478530 C0700325 C3887460 C0007220 C0436125 C0497234 C0233492 C0445356 C0150369 C1283169 C0026426 C0182230 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0034975 C0441621 C0683314 C0425946 C0558058 C3245481 C0580931 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0189573 C2024834 C0396664 C0199535 C0849557 C0243161 C1096775 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 ", "concepts": "Intervention, Interventions, intervention, intervention, Registry, Vascular, Vasculat, Lazio summary, summary catheterisation, IVC catheterisation, radial arteries, Radial artery, studies CVS - Cardiovascular procedure, cardiovascular procedures, Other cardiovascular procedure, cardiovascular procedure results, vascular procedures, Medical cardiovascular procedure, femoral confirmation, specific, study, Observational, observation, observation cardiovascular, cardiovascular drug, cardiovascular exam, Pain;cardiovascular, elated, Unrelated monitoring, Monitoring, monitoring BP, monitoring ph, Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure, registry, sampled state of health, short period, reflecting, temporary care criteria, Eligibility Criteria CVS - Cardiovascular procedure, cardiovascular procedures, Other cardiovascular procedures, Medical cardiovascular procedure, cardiovascular procedure results Criteria clinical trials, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient "}
