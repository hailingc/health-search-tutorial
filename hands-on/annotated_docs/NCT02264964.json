{"text": "TITLE:\n      Duration and Adverse Events of Non-cuffed Catheter in Patients With Hemodialysis\nSUMMARY:\n      The duration and adverse events of non-cuffed catheter in patients with hemodialysis will be\n      investigated by multicenter prospective cohort. Totally, 1,400 patients with chronic renal\n      failure requiring hemodialysis will be enrolled. 900 patients will be given right internal\n      jugular catheterization, and the other 500 patients unsuitable for right internal jugular\n      catheterization will receive femoral catheterizations. Every patient will be followed-up for\n      six months. During following-up period, the duration time and adverse events of non-cuffed\n      catheter will be recorded in details, including inadequate hemodialysis blood flow, venous\n      stenosis, venous thrombosis, infection, catheter thrombosis and so on. The central vein will\n      be evaluated by CT Angiography to identify its stenosis at last visit after 6 months. This\n      multicentre trial will provide evidence to develop guideline for duration time of using\n      non-cuffed catheter.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis.\n          -  No medical history of central vena catheterization.\n          -  Maintenance hemodialysis after central vena catheterization.\n          -  Signed informed consent.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Had been performed central venous puncture or catheterization before.\n          -  Can not use heparin.\n          -  Refused to sign the informed consent.\n          -  Advanced cancer patients.\n          -  With or will take arteriovenous fistula surgery in right arm.\n          -  Other inappropriate situation\n", "cuis": "C1705413 C0877248 C0019004 C0577541 C0720099 C2926735 C0085590 C1546572 C1704454 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0877248 C1963761 C0019004 C0085590 C1704454 C1546572 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C0022646 C0019004 C3244317 C3244072 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0542382 C1997041 C0501117 C0007430 C0191117 C2025500 C2025504 C0398266 C0770826 C0015811 C0877248 C1963761 C0025344 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C1561542 C0019004 C0232338 C0455822 C0455848 C0085590 C1704454 C1546572 C0182913 C0042487 C0517555 C0149871 C0740384 C2728549 C0040038 C1116449 C0040053 C2586211 C0302148 C0009450 C3714514 C0275524 C0012683 C0035637 C0276041 C0729555 C0747002 C1261287 C0085590 C1704454 C1546572 C0002978 C2135970 C1261287 C0220825 C3858576 C1561542 C0282423 C0162791 C0220845 C1555587 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C0018792 C2363670 C0085590 C1704454 C1546572 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0022661 C2316810 C0301609 C0271932 C0019004 C0262926 C0422836 C0455458 C0007430 C0191117 C2025500 C2025504 C0398266 C0770826 C4040576 C0007430 C0191117 C2025500 C2025504 C0398266 C0770826 C1519316 C0009797 C0243161 C0340778 C0007430 C0191117 C2025500 C2025504 C0398266 C0770826 C0019134 C0770546 C0009797 C0877373 C0230346 C4048756 C1268255 C2221330 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C2963140 C0752156 C3878495 C2230323 C1546725 C1546836 C1546840 C1547233 C1547241 C1547267 C1547272 C1547281 C1547304 C1547309 C1547994 C1549063 C1549110 C1556055 C1561608 C1868670 C2598149 C1955473 C0021141 ", "concepts": "Adverse Events, Adverse Event, Hemodialysis, Hemodialysis NEC, Duration, Duration, catheter, Catheter, catheter, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary adverse events, No adverse event, hemodialysis, Catheter, Catheter, Catheter, Induration, Duration, Duration renal hemodialysis, given, internalId, Fright, Bright, wright, Wright jugular vein catheterization, Vascular catheterization, right internal jugular catheterization, IVC catheterization, IVC catheterization, SVC catheterization, vein catheterization, catheterization kits, femoral adverse events, No adverse event, period, Induration, Duration, Duration, month hemodialysis, blood flow, LV blood flow, RV blood flow, Catheter, Catheter, Catheter, recorder Venous thrombosis NOS, Venous thrombosis, venous thrombosis deep, sinus venous thrombosis, acute venous thrombosis, Venous thrombosis NOS, central vein, Thrombosis, thrombosis, Thrombosis, Infection, infections, Coinfections, Disinfection, RP infection, MG infection, GI infection, op infection, stenosis, Catheter, Catheter, Catheter Angiography, last visit, stenosis, Evaluated, deidentify, month Guideline, Guideline, guidelines, provider, Induration, Duration, Duration, Atrial, developer Catheter, Catheter, Catheter criteria, Eligibility Criteria CRF - Chronic renal failure, Chronic renal failure, Chronic renal failure diet, Chronic renal failure anemia, hemodialysis medical history, No medical history, Past medical history, catheterization, IVC catheterization, IVC catheterization, SVC catheterization, vein catheterization, catheterization kits Maintenance hemodialysis, catheterization, IVC catheterization, IVC catheterization, SVC catheterization, vein catheterization, catheterization kits Signed, informed consent form Criteria venous puncture, catheterization, IVC catheterization, IVC catheterization, SVC catheterization, vein catheterization, catheterization kits heparins, heparin informed consent form Advanced cancer Right arm, Right arm, Right arm, BP right arm, surgery, surgery, surgery:, Arteriovenous fistula, dural arteriovenous fistula, Arteriovenous fistula kit, arteriovenous fistula on exam Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Others, ADH inappropriate "}
