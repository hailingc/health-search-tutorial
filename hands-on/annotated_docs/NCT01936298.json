{"text": "TITLE:\n      Robot-assisted Rehabilitation of Hand by Paralysis of the Upper Limb After Stroke\nSUMMARY:\n      The investigators evaluate the effectiveness of the application of continuous passive motion\n      device for hand rehabilitation in two classes of patients: with a residual active motion and\n      without a residual active motion.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      We will conduct a double blind clinical trial. A sample size calculation were performed to\n      determine the necessary number of subjects needed for this study and was based upon the\n      results of a previous pilot study. All patients had functional impairments of their upper\n      extremities after the stroke.\n      We hypothesized that the hand-rehabilitation oriented with robotics assistance, would\n      improve edema by paralysis of the upper limb even in patient without sensory pathway\n      recovery.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  a history of acute phase of stroke (less than 12 months post onset),\n          -  first stroke episode,\n          -  no history of peripheral nerve injury or musculoskeletal disease in the affected\n             upper extremity,\n          -  no contracture of the affected wrist or fingers (Modified Ashworth<3),\n          -  no history of any invasive procedure (Botulinum toxin type A) for the treatment of\n             spasticity for at least 6 months before the start of this study,\n          -  for P-ROM patients, the absence of active hand movements,\n          -  for the A-ROM patients, the presence of active hand movements.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  unstable medical disorders,\n          -  active Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS),\n          -  severe spatial neglect,\n          -  aphasia,\n          -  cognitive problems.\n", "cuis": "C0034991 C0007237 C0018459 C0080102 C0204601 C0728952 C3534574 C1140618 C0522224 C0038454 C0018563 C1281583 C1552616 C1706244 C0185125 C0376495 C1947919 C2347934 C0185026 C0013987 C1444662 C0220825 C0007237 C0034991 C0018459 C4042802 C0204096 C0204601 C0728952 C0419104 C0458264 C0456387 C0018563 C0231481 C0231481 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C1096775 C0456909 C0441621 C3845732 C0947630 C0947630 C0684336 C2598156 C0031843 C0015385 C0278454 C0038454 C0007237 C0034991 C0018459 C4042802 C0204096 C0204601 C0728952 C0419104 C0458264 C0018563 C1280910 C1961028 C0682651 C1140618 C0153664 C1269078 C0522224 C0013604 C2004454 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0262926 C2004062 C0038454 C1561542 C0038454 C0262593 C0273529 C1260908 C0451662 C0495832 C0026857 C0559112 C1290137 C0455442 C0260524 C1290136 C0497289 C0262926 C2004062 C1140618 C2318044 C0230330 C0239377 C1114524 C1524375 C2117118 C0016129 C0947619 C0947620 C0043262 C3542952 C0006050 C0006051 C0382979 C2719430 C4048276 C0814177 C3515079 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0262926 C2004062 C0026838 C1552850 C0947630 C1561542 C0018563 C0424530 C1320102 C0026649 C0392148 C0018563 C1320102 C0026649 C0243161 C0012634 C0007222 C0017178 C0443343 C0458219 C0034931 C0007462 C1320102 C0871399 C0751421 C0866957 C1306232 C0003537 C3842628 ", "concepts": "Rehabilitation, NOS, rehabilitation, habilitation, Rehabilitation NEC, Drug Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation;drug, Lung Rehabilitation, Upper Limb, Paralysis, Stroke, Hand, Hand summary, summary applications, Reapplication, Application, Application, plication, Emotion, Discontinuous, Evaluate rehabilitation, care rehabilitation, habilitation, Telerehabilitations, Neurorehabilitation, drug rehabilitation, drug rehabilitation, Oral rehabilitation, Pain rehabilitation, classes, hand, Active motion Active motion description, prescription, prescription clinical trial, blind, sampled, Miscalculation study study, impairment, Impairments, function Extremities, extremities, stroke rehabilitation, care rehabilitation, habilitation, Telerehabilitations, Neurorehabilitation, drug rehabilitation, drug rehabilitation, Oral rehabilitation, Pain rehabilitation, hand, assistances, Oriented sensory pathway, Upper limb, Upper limb, Upper limb, paralysis, edema recover criteria, Eligibility Criteria history, history, stroke, month stroke Peripheral nerve injury, NOS, Arm peripheral nerve injury, Leg peripheral nerve injury, peripheral nerve injury of neck, peripheral nerve injury thorax, musculoskeletal disease, H/O: musculoskeletal disease, Acute musculoskeletal disease, FH: Musculoskeletal disease, Other musculoskeletal diseases, Chronic musculoskeletal disease, Musculoskeletal disease other, history, history upper extremity, upper extremity MRA, Left upper extremity, upper extremity pain, Upper extremity US, Upper extremity CT contracture, fingers, R fingers, L fingers, wrist, Modifier botulinum toxin type a, botulinum toxin type b, botulinum toxin type F, botulinum toxin type B, invasive procedure, Noninvasive procedure, Fetal invasive procedure, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, history, history spasticity, start, study, month hand, absences, Factive, Movements presence, hand, Factive, Movements Criteria disorders, CV disorders, GI disorders, unstable Pain Syndromes, Regional Complex, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, Type I, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type II, Factive spatial neglect, hemispatial neglect, visuospatial neglect, severed aphasia Cognitive problems "}
