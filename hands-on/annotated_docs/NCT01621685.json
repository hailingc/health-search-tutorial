{"text": "TITLE:\n      Human Safety of Capsaicin Inhalation Challenge Testing for Young and Older Men\nSUMMARY:\n      In 2004, the investigators initiated a human Capsaicin inhalation experiment under an\n      Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol approved by the FDA (IND 69,642) and the subject\n      safety procedures instituted and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). As part\n      of the study protocol, inhaled Capsaicin solutions were analyzed using high performance\n      liquid chromatography (HPLC). The investigation employed safety procedures while conducting\n      the human inhalation investigations. In addition, during our investigations we observed\n      discrepancies between the predicted Capsaicin concentrations mixed by a registered\n      pharmacist and the actual capsaicin concentrations determined by HPLC. The stability of\n      Capsaicin solutions stored over a seven month period and refrigerated at 4degrees C and\n      protected against ultraviolet light were examined.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      After a research subject's death during an inhalation study using medications/drugs not\n      approved for this route, the FDA prohibited human use of non-approved chemicals including\n      capsaicin administered via inhalation.\n      Capsaicin inhalation challenge tests (CICT) were performed on forty men of different ages\n      utilizing pharmaceutical grade Capsaicin. Solutions were mixed by a registered pharmacist\n      and Capsaicin doses, administered to subjects, were analyzed by high performance liquid\n      chromatography (HPLC). Capsaicin solutions were stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C and\n      shielded from ultraviolet light for 7 months. There was serial monitoring by spirometry and\n      impulse oscillometry, electrocardiography, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen saturation\n      measurements.\n      There were no adverse reactions at any dose, including the highest capsaicin concentration.\n      Serial spirometry and impulse oscillometry, electrocardiography, blood pressure, pulse and\n      oxygen saturation measurements did not change. The actual amount of pharmaceutical-grade\n      capsaicin measured was 85.5% of the concentrations estimated by the registered pharmacist at\n      time of mixing. The difference was more for the lowest 0.49 uMol dose (28.1) compared to a\n      2.2% lesser concentration for the 1000 uMol solution. Capsaicin concentrations fell after 3\n      months of storage.\n      Dilute capsaicin aerosol inhalation is relatively innocuous and CICT is safe. The actual\n      amount of pharmaceutical-grade capsaicin inhaled by subjects is less than the estimate at\n      mixing. Capsaicin loses potency after 3-months of protected storage. Inhalation studies\n      involving non-approved drugs or chemicals/medications can be safely conducted when they\n      follow the appropriate safety procedures such as described in this investigation.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          1.
