{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effectiveness and Safety of Minoxidil Foam Versus Placebo Foam for Androgenetic Alopecia\nSUMMARY:\n      The current study aims to show efficacy of twice daily application of 5% Minoxidil Topical\n      Foam (MTF) formulation compared to placebo in the temple region of male patients with\n      androgenetic alopecia after 24 weeks as well as to gain long-term data on the efficacy and\n      safety of 5% MTF in male subjects with AGA in temple and vertex region, over a period of 2\n      years. Objective and subjective efficacy measures will be compared to baseline. Moreover,\n      all patients will get the equal treatment and measurements in the vertex region to enable\n      comparison of the efficacy of 5% Minoxidil Topical Foam in the temples not only to baseline\n      but also to vertex region. Additionally safety assessments will be performed throughout the\n      whole study.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Male, age 18 to 70 year old, in general good health\n          -  Exhibits male AGA based on a discernable hair loss in temple and vertex region rating\n             Hamilton-Norwood Scale III vertex to VI (See Appendix 1)\n          -  Subjects who give their consent to the study after thorough explanation and who\n             personally signed and dated the informed consent document indicating that the\n             subject, has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial\n          -  Willing to maintain the same hairstyle, hair length and hair color throughout the\n             study\n          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,\n             mini-tattoo and other trial procedures\n          -  Accepting the Information form plus accepting and signing the Informed Consent form\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Known to be hypersensitive to minoxidil, hair dye (p-phenylenediamine), tattoo ink,\n             fragrances, hair gel or any vehicle components\n          -  Current or 4 weeks dated back use of medical shampoos or solutions which include\n             Ketoconazole or the like (e. g.
