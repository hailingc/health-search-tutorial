{"text": "TITLE:\n      The Influence Of GIP (Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide) Infusion On Human Adipose Tissue: An In Vivo Study\nSUMMARY:\n      Study part-1\n      GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) is one of the two main incretin hormones\n      secreted by specialized cells of the gastrointestinal tract in response to ingestion of\n      nutrients. Data emerging from studies in animal models and cultured human fat cells support\n      a physiological role for GIP in the adipose tissue metabolism which may contribute to the\n      pathogenesis of obesity.\n      The proposed study will shed more light on the interactions between gut hormones and adipose\n      tissue. For this pilot study, male subjects fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be given\n      GIP or placebo infusions in a randomized manner. Fat tissue biopsies will be obtained from\n      all subjects during both visits, once in the basal state (before the start of the\n      peptide/placebo infusion) and then repeated at the end of the period of infusion.\n      Study part-2\n      Surgery represents the most effective therapeutic modality for morbid obesity. Resolution of\n      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been consistently observed as an additional benefit of\n      surgical treatment of obesity. The mechanisms underlying the dramatic effects of surgery on\n      insulin sensitivity and \u03b2-cell function are poorly understood. Bariatric surgery (gastric\n      bypass) promotes changes in the enteroendocrine system as a result of nutrient diversion\n      from the physiological intestinal routes with subsequent profound modification of gut\n      hormone secretion\n      We hypothesize that restoration of GIP action after bariatric procedures plays a cardinal\n      role in the improvement and/or restoration of diabetes, we propose to study patients (both\n      sex)with morbid obesity and T2DM within 3 months after their surgery. Their responses will\n      be compared to those of BMI matched control subjects with normal glucose tolerance\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Lean (BMI 20-25 kg/m2) subjects with normal glucose tolerance\n          -  Obese (BMI >30 kg/m2) subjects also with normal glucose tolerance.\n          -  Obese with impaired glucose tolerance\n          -  Obese with diet controlled diabetes mellitus\n          -  Morbid obesity, type diabetes and post bariatric surgery (study part 2)\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  History of severe cardiac, hepatic or renal disease\n          -  Thyroid dysfunction (hyper-or hypothyroidism), or other endocrine disturbance\n             (acromegaly, growth hormone deficiency, hypoadrenalism or cortisol overproduction)\n          -  Current malignant disease\n          -  Known alcohol misuse\n          -  Major psychiatric disease (including current use of antidepressants)\n          -  History of major eating disorder (anorexia or bulimia nervosa)\n", "cuis": "C0017132 C0574032 C1547928 C0947630 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C1562292 C0017725 C1299583 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C1185740 C2707256 C0596601 C0809794 C0017173 C0184122 C0687713 C0920703 C0017181 C0017185 C0203054 C0237938 C0436865 C0744333 C0849766 C1141929 C2697368 C0947630 C0015677 C0430400 C3540698 C3853906 C1707944 C0025519 C3822292 C1704326 C0699748 C0028754 C0947630 C0699819 C0037420 C0275586 C4050469 C0243161 C0947630 C3244317 C0574032 C1293131 C0005558 C0032042 C0015677 C3272929 C1552850 C1512346 C0574032 C0854643 C0032042 C0025344 C0202100 C0030953 C0291443 C0388060 C0947630 C0028756 C1514893 C0543467 C1705196 C3842534 C3842535 C3842536 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C1547664 C0011860 C0011854 C2919802 C4014362 C0543467 C2363849 C0028754 C1457907 C2081627 C0920563 C1864570 C1456587 C0031843 C1705273 C0038351 C0224155 C1304960 C0185033 C3840275 C0741847 C0021853 C1292984 C0699819 C3840684 C0036537 C0449982 C0025664 C0184661 C1552007 C0600138 C0449982 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0947630 C1704326 C3844714 C0028756 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C1704632 C1561542 C0178665 C0017741 C0029161 C0430123 C1553386 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0178665 C0017741 C0029161 C0430123 C1553386 C3843388 C0178665 C0017741 C0029161 C0430123 C1553386 C0028754 C0271650 C0159069 C2830475 C0028754 C0011849 C0011878 C0455488 C0743140 C0011860 C1313937 C0743195 C0028754 C1456587 C0028756 C1320657 C0948892 C0948893 C0011854 C0011860 C0947630 C0243161 C0022658 C0001621 C1857414 C0262926 C2004062 C0018787 C0205054 C1306232 C0348024 C0030517 C0020676 C0455486 C0014130 C0271561 C3714796 C1720505 C1849662 C2676308 C0013338 C0001622 C0020595 C0001623 C0001206 C0442867 C0260515 C0001962 C0001975 C0549649 C0003289 C2698157 C1579361 C1741963 C1508125 C0012634 C0018609 C1548428 C3526598 C0013473 C0031873 C2267227 C0003123 C0426579 C0003620 C1963063 C0262926 C2004062 ", "concepts": "Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide, Infusion, Tissue, Study summary, summary Study incretin, glucose, Independent Response, Response, Response, tract, Gastrointestinal, gastrointestinal gas, gastrointestines, gastrointestinal agent, gastrointestinal tubes, gastrointestinal pains, gastrointestinal sign, gastrointestinal bleed, gastrointestinal tumor, X-ray gastrointestinal, Ulcer gastrointestinal, O/E -
