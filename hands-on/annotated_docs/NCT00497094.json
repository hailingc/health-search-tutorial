{"text": "TITLE:\n      Stenting Versus Best Medical Treatment of Asymptomatic High Grade Carotid Artery Stenosis\nSUMMARY:\n      Background. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) recently has become an accepted method for\n      treatment of patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis, who are at an increased risk\n      for surgical carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The reported rates of neurological complications\n      of CAS substantially decreased during the past years, and the routine use of cerebral\n      protection devices and low profile catheter systems have further increased the procedure\u00b4s\n      safety. In the early 90's large surgical trials in North America and Europe (NASCET, ECST\n      and ACAS) demonstrated superiority of CEA compared to best medical treatment for symptomatic\n      and asymptomatic patients. Provided that the ongoing randomized controlled trials comparing\n      CAS and CEA confirm equivalence between the these methods, CAS similar to CEA is applicable\n      to symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high grade carotid stenosis. However,\n      particularly in asymptomatic patients, the indication for revascularisation remains\n      debatable. Protected CAS is associated with a very low rate of neurological complications,\n      which are below the AHA recommendation for treating asymptomatic patients (3%). However, the\n      introduction of new vascular protective medications like statins and clopidogrel during the\n      recent years substantially improved the spectrum of best medical treatment, and the findings\n      of NASCET, ECST and ACAS with respect to best medical treatment may therefore not be\n      applicable any more.\n      Study hypothesis and aims. Given the low frequency of spontaneous neurological\n      complications, the preferable therapeutic approach to patients with asymptomatic high grade\n      ( > 80%) carotid artery stenoses is currently unknown. Modern best medical treatment may\n      manage to stabilize the atherosclerotic plaque, while CAS has the potential of resolving the\n      carotid stenosis. Comparative data, however, are not available as yet. We hypothesized that\n      protected CAS has a beneficial effect on occurrence of ipsilateral neurological\n      complications and major adverse cardiac events in high-risk patients with asymptomatic > 80%\n      internal carotid artery stenosis. Therefore, the aim of the present randomized controlled\n      trial was to analyze neurological and cardiovascular outcome of patients treated with\n      elective CAS plus best medical treatment compared to best medical treatment only.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Carotid artery stenting (CAS) recently has become an accepted method for treatment of\n      patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis, who are at an increased risk for surgical\n      carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
