{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effects of High Voltage Electrical Stimulation, Shortwave Diathermy and Kinesiotherapy on Arterial Blood Flow in the Lower Limbs of Diabetic Women\nSUMMARY:\n      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a pathological condition limiting, resulting from a\n      narrowing or occlusion of the artery diameter due to aneurysms, inflammation,\n      atherosclerosis and thromboembolic events. One of the main risk factors for the development\n      of DAP is diabetes mellitus due to its relation to the process of atherogenesis. Thus, the\n      objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of three treatment modalities for PAD on\n      the blood flow velocity. It is a crossover study. Fifteen women with diabetes receive three\n      types of treatment, the order defined according draw: high voltage electrical stimulation,\n      shortwave diathermy and kinesiotherapy. The blood flow of the lower limb will be assessed by\n      Doppler ultrasound. The hypothesis of this study is that physical therapy resources increase\n      the circulation of the lower limb.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Women\n          -  Diagnosis of diabetes\n          -  Diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Regular physical activity\n          -  Smokers\n          -  Thrombosis active\n          -  Severe peripheral arterial disease\n", "cuis": "C0013786 C3899490 C0374492 C0180687 C0013787 C0302825 C1096702 C1369650 C1550611 C0023216 C0012002 C0203597 C0241863 C0235146 C1552616 C1706244 C1704436 C0085096 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0182158 C0332568 C0021368 C0007971 C0014236 C0017574 C0029877 C0854217 C0028778 C0854571 C0002940 C0003842 C1314680 C0004153 C0029899 C1611706 C0150988 C0029696 C0333494 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0040038 C0011849 C0011878 C0455488 C0743140 C0011860 C1313937 C1563937 C0233492 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0947630 C0182158 C0332568 C0220825 C0232338 C0455822 C0455848 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0947630 C0013786 C0374492 C0180687 C0565529 C2147202 C2147230 C2147241 C2080748 C2147193 C2147214 C2147238 C2147249 C2150221 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1522411 C3244315 C2021219 C1096702 C0232338 C0455822 C0455848 C0023216 C0153665 C1269079 C0012002 C0203597 C0162481 C2121481 C2322139 C2367216 C0029709 C0949766 C0553651 C0204093 C1948126 C2064714 C2148126 C0947630 C0449416 C0005775 C1516559 C0023216 C0153665 C1269079 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0011900 C0945731 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0085096 C1704436 C0011900 C0945731 C0243161 C0178520 C0337664 C0040053 C0302148 C2586211 C1320102 C0085096 C1704436 C1547227 C1547231 C1561581 C4050465 C4050466 C0264097 ", "concepts": "Electrical Stimulations, Cranial Electrical Stimulation, Electrical stimulation, Electrical Stimulators, Electrical Stimulation Therapy, Electrical Brain Stimulation, Kinesiotherapy, Kinesiotherapy Note, Arterial Blood, Lower Limbs, diathermy, diathermy, Diabetic, High summary, summary peripheral arterial disease, arterial diseases peripheral, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, pad, pad inflammation, inflammation lip, Eye inflammation, gum inflammation, inflammation ear, Jaw inflammation, occlusion, Reocclusion, aneurysms, artery, Farrowing atherosclerosis, Otosclerosis, Myosclerosis, Acrosclerosis, Other otosclerosis, Venosclerosis, risk factors, risk factors, No risk factors, A/N risk factors, development, Development, Development, Development, No development, thromboembolic event diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetes mellitus diet, H/O: diabetes mellitus, diabetes mellitus risk, NIDDM diabetes mellitus, FH: Diabetes mellitus, Atherogenesis, elation Objective, objective, Objective, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, study, pad, pad, Evaluate blood flow, LV blood flow, RV blood flow, Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes, study electric stimulation, Electrical stimulation, electrical stimulator, Other electrical stimulation, electrical stimulation of arm, electrical stimulation of hip, electrical stimulation of calf, Russian electrical stimulation, electrical stimulation of neck, electrical stimulation of hand, electrical stimulation of knee, electrical stimulation of foot, electrical stimulation of heel, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, Border, orders, QRS high voltage kinesiotherapy, blood flow, LV blood flow, RV blood flow, lower limbs, Lower limb, Lower limb, Diathermy, Diathermy Doppler ultrasound, renal Doppler ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound penis, Doppler ultrasound liver, physical; therapy, physical therapies, Other physical therapy, other physical therapy, physical therapy care, chest physical therapy, physical therapy goals, study, sources circulations, Circulation, lower limbs, Lower limb, Lower limb criteria, Eligibility Criteria {Diagnosis}, Diagnosis, Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes arterial diseases peripheral, peripheral arterial disease, {Diagnosis}, Diagnosis Criteria body physical activity Smoker thrombosis, Thrombosis, thrombosis, Factive arterial diseases peripheral, peripheral arterial disease, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Sever "}
