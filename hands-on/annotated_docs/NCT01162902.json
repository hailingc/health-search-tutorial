{"text": "TITLE:\n      Comparison of Vascular Remodeling Between Different Antianginal Medication Evaluated by Noninvasive ECG-gated Fundus Photographic Evaluation\nSUMMARY:\n      Treatments for stable angina includes drug therapy such as calcium-channel blocker, beta\n      blocker, and ACEI/ARB. To obtain good prognosis in patients with coronary artery\n      disease,preventing or correcting the progression of atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia is more\n      important than relieving angina symptom. Dysfunction of microvessel is one of the most\n      important factor in patients with coronary artery disease. Recently, we developed the new\n      non-invasive method of evaluating the microvessel in fundus. With this methods, we will\n      compare the effect of each drug (beta blocker, CCB, ARB).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Stable angina patients whose coronary lesions is confirmed by angiography or receives\n             PCI\n          -  Unstable Angina/NSTEMI patients who completed PCI for main lesions\n          -  Either systolic > 130mmHg or diastolic > 80mmHg, or patients with anti-hypertensive\n             drugs\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  STEMI patients within one month\n          -  Variant Angina\n          -  Liver function abnormality or renal failure\n          -  History of Hypersensitivity to testing drugs\n          -  Severe heart failure(NYHA class>3) or uncorrectable hematologic disease\n          -  Woman possible to be pregnant\n          -  Uncontrolled diabetes\n          -  Expected life span < one year\n", "cuis": "C3537168 C0013227 C0802604 C2598133 C3840903 C3843493 C3843494 C2081612 C0220825 C1261322 C0005847 C0042383 C0016823 C0017129 C0227254 C0227817 C0740422 C1548899 C1552616 C1706244 C0006684 C0452117 C0481183 C0340288 C0002965 C0013216 C0599938 C0087111 C1533734 C0205042 C1269008 C1261082 C0545743 C0278250 C0004153 C0029899 C1611706 C0150988 C0029696 C0333494 C0242339 C0020473 C0242656 C0012634 C0018609 C0858277 C0277785 C2350570 C0010054 C1956346 C0010068 C1578513 C2363670 C0025663 C0025664 C0740422 C2350570 C1334278 C0001645 C0013227 C1254351 C0175556 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0340288 C0002965 C0002978 C1536105 C1690968 C0018787 C0221198 C0002965 C0340288 C0221198 C0857121 C0947663 C0003364 C3844638 C0018790 C1995642 C0012000 C0428883 C0013227 C0243161 C1561542 C0002963 C0035078 C0001623 C1963154 C3267129 C3810103 C1167727 C0031843 C1705273 C0023884 C0023899 C0496870 C0721399 C0872387 C1278929 C1704258 C3809765 C0020517 C0520946 C0559469 C0577620 C0013182 C0016470 C0079840 C3489856 C0441750 C0577628 C0949570 C0262926 C2004062 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C0013227 C0018939 C0037274 C1263982 C1547227 C1547231 C1561581 C4050465 C4050466 C0264097 C0018787 C0549206 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0857250 C1517001 C2243104 C1561543 ", "concepts": "Antianginal, medications, Medications, Medications, Medication 2, Medication 3, Medication 1, medication:, Evaluated, evaluation, Vascular, Vasculat, Fundus, Fundus, Fundus, Fundus, Fundus, Photographs summary, summary calcium channel blockers, Calcium-channel blockers, Calcium-channel blockers, stable angina, Unstable angina, drug therapy, nondrug therapy, Treatment, Treatment coronary arteries, Coronary artery, coronary artery left, artery coronary, good prognosis atherosclerosis, Otosclerosis, Myosclerosis, Acrosclerosis, Other otosclerosis, Venosclerosis, dyslipidemia, lipidemia, progression, disease, h disease angina symptom, Dysfunction, Microvessel coronary artery diseases, CAD (coronary artery disease), coronary diseases, new, developer method, methods, fundus, Microvessel, Invasive beta blocker, drug, drug, ccb criteria, Eligibility Criteria Stable angina, Unstable angina, angiography, CT angiography, US angiography, coronary, lesions Unstable Angina, Stable Angina, lesions hypertensive, hypertensin, Antihypertensive, Either, Asystolic, Bystolic, Diastolic, diastolic BP drugs Criteria month Variant Angina renal failure, Adrenal failure, Renal failure, Prerenal failure, No renal failure, Postrenal failure, function, Function, Livers, Liver, Liver, Liver, Liver, Liver, Abnormality, No abnormality hypersensitivity, Hypersensitivity, Hypersensitivity, Egg, Hypersensitivity, Nut, Hypersensitivity, Drug, Hypersensitivity, Food, Hypersensitivity, Milk, Cold Hypersensitivity, Hypersensitivity types, Latex Hypersensitivity, Wheat Hypersensitivity, History, History, testing, q testing, t testing, drugs hematological disease, dermatologic diseases, Acute hematologic disease, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Sever, heart pregnant Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes, Uncontrolled INR Expected, span, year "}
