{"text": "TITLE:\n      Clinical Predictors of Pediatric OSAHS\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to develop adequate and satisfactory tools using reliable\n      clinical and physical factors in predicting pediatric obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea\n      syndrome (OSAHS) and allow greater access to appropriate therapy in children.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The prevalence of OSAHS is estimated to be about 1% to 4% in children, however, it is\n      frequently underdiagnosed because of the difficulties for evaluation.Current diagnostic\n      approaches are based on the patient's history, clinical presentation and physical\n      examination, endoscopy, and radiological imaging examinations, and confirmation is made by\n      the current gold standard of full-night polysomnography (PSG). Previous studies have\n      reported the use of a clinical history, physical examination and questionnaires for\n      predicting pediatric OSAHS but there were lacking of adequate and satisfactory results.\n      Despite the potential diagnostic benefits, PSG for pediatric patients are not routinely used\n      in clinical practice. Therefore, to obtain a reliable, valid, and easily-performed\n      diagnostic or screening tool for the clinical assessment of pediatric OSAHS is essential for\n      the cost-effective care of these patients.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  children (younger than 18 years old and older than 2 years old) with symptoms of\n             snoring and then were confirmed to having obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome\n             by a comprehensive polysomnography\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  patients with substance abuse problems or the long-term usage of medications known to\n             affect sleep, craniofacial abnormalities or neuromuscular disorders, Down syndrome,\n             cerebral palsy, mucopolysaccharidoses, Prader-Willi syndrome, history of psychosis,\n             central sleep apnea syndrome, or previous airway surgery including tonsillectomy\n             and/or adenoidectomy were excluded from the study.\n",
