{"text": "TITLE:\n      RISE: A Clinical Evaluation of the StarClose\u2122 Vascular Closure System\nSUMMARY:\n      To evaluate early ambulation in patients who receive the StarClose\u2122 VCS post-percutaneous\n      diagnostic procedure.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      To evaluate the StarClose\u2122 VCS in the femoral artery in subjects who are ambulated early\n      post-percutaneous cardiac or peripheral vascular, diagnostic catheterization procedure. The\n      clinical use of vascular closure devices for rapid hemostasis after femoral access was first\n      reported in 1991. 18 participants may be ambulated almost immediately after diagnostic\n      coronary angiography and discharged many hours earlier than currently practiced in most\n      centers utilizing a supine restriction period of 6 hours after diagnostic catheterization.14\n      After coronary interventions, participant comfort is additionally increased by immediate\n      sheath removal.\n      This early ambulation study is an evaluation of a clip-based technology, which achieves\n      vascular hemostasis with the use of a novel extravascular Nitinol clip to provide an\n      immediate mechanical closure that does not depend upon the body's clotting system. The\n      procedures will be performed in participants who meet specific entrance criteria.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion:\n          -  Subject must be 18-85.\n          -  Subject must be an acceptable candidate for an elective,non-emergent diagnostic\n             procedure performed percutaneously via the common femoral artery through either a 5F\n             or 6F procedural sheath.\n          -  Subject is an acceptable candidate for emergent vascular surgery.\n          -  Subject agrees to follow-up evaluations to assess for complications related to\n             femoral access site.\n          -  If among the 50 ultrasound sub-study Subjects enrolled,Subject agrees to have an\n             ultrasound of femoral artery performed post-procedure during the 30 \u00b1 7 days\n             follow-up visit.\n          -  Subject or legal representative has been informed of the nature of the study and\n             agrees to provisions and has provided written
