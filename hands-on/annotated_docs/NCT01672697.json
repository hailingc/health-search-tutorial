{"text": "TITLE:\n      Physical Therapy for Women With Obstetric Trauma and Anal Incontinence\nSUMMARY:\n      Our primary objective is to determine if physical therapy (PT) and behavioral therapy (BT)\n      in the post-partum period after a vaginal delivery complicated by genital trauma help to\n      improve a woman's quality of life, specifically in regard to anal incontinence. To be able\n      to study this, the investigators need to know how well the muscles of a woman's pelvic floor\n      function after a vaginal delivery and this requires measuring their strength during a pelvic\n      exam. At present, there are no studies that have looked at whether the intervention of PT/BT\n      improves a woman's anal incontinence quality of life after sustaining genital trauma during\n      vaginal deliveries\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This is a prospective trial involving 65 woman who sustained a severe laceration or\n      episiotomy during their first vaginal delivery to determine if postpartum intervention with\n      physical/behavioral therapy improves their quality of life in regard to anal incontinence.\n      The primary outcome measure is functional and based on a change in score of the Fecal\n      Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQOL) validated questionnaire from baseline (2-weeks after\n      delivery date) to study completion (12-weeks after delivery date). The secondary outcome\n      measure is physiologic and reflects a change in anal sphincter resting tone from baseline to\n      study completion.\n      After the screening questionnaires to determine eligibility in the study, each study subject\n      will be consented for participation then undergo a baseline physical exam (including pelvic\n      exam and rectal exam) at a range of 2- to 4- weeks after delivery date. In addition, after\n      this initial exam, all women will be randomized immediately to receive (1) no further\n      treatments, or (2) physical and behavioral therapy.\n      The investigators will study these two groups of women for 24 total weeks after the date of\n      delivery. The intervention group will include patients randomized to receiving PT/BT for 4\n      weekly sessions after their vaginal delivery and laceration (episiotomy) repair. The control\n      group (no intervention) will include patients randomized to receiving the standard of care\n      (no physical or behavioral therapy) after their vaginal delivery and laceration (episiotomy)\n      repair.\n      Each group will undergo the baseline testing: a pelvic exam (to measure the strength of your\n      muscles) and anal-rectal manometry (i.e. rectal exam with insertion of a small sensor to\n      measure the strength of your sphincter); and be asked to complete a series of brief\n      questionnaires. These questionnaires will be administered again to both groups at 6-weeks,\n      12-weeks, and 24-weeks after their delivery date. Study completion physical exams including\n      a repeat pelvic exam and repeat anal-rectal manometry will be conducted at 12-weeks after\n      delivery date.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Primiparous women aged 18 years of older\n          -  Vaginal delivery, vacuum-assisted-vaginal-delivery (VAVD), or\n             forceps-assisted-vaginal-delivery (FAVD) of a neonate of gestational age:\n          -  27 completed weeks\n          -  Singleton or vaginal delivery of multiple gestation\n          -  Able to read and speak the English language\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Unable to comply with physical therapy or office visits\n          -  Unreliable transportation\n          -  Preexisting neurologic, musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disorder rendering them\n             unable to perform physical therapy requirements\n          -  Cesarean delivery\n          -  History of prior surgery for anorectal incontinence (i.e. sphincteroplasty\n", "cuis": "C0949766 C1547999 C2064714 C0021167 C0085099 C0043251 C3263723 C3714660 C0003461 C0587597 C1552616 C1706244 C0004933 C0029709 C0949766 C0553651 C0204093 C1948126 C2064714 C2148126 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0566690 C2114516 C1541822 C2094780 C0025344 C3263723 C3714660 C1552861 C0017420 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C0021167 C0003461 C1299581 C0206248 C1283846 C0947630 C0566690 C2114516 C1541822 C2094780 C0031843 C1705273 C0030797 C3245501 C3245502 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0947630 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C0021167 C3263723 C3714660 C0003461 C0017420 C0487602 C0042232 C0750103 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0043246 C0332821 C0333525 C0558143 C1306232 C0018792 C0566690 C2114516 C1541822 C2094780 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0014586 C0004933 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C0021167 C0003461 C0031809 C1509143 C3272557 C0015733 C0031843 C3242613 C0518214 C0034394 C1706422 C0815327 C0021167 C0085099 C0728774 C2825543 C2053594 C0027627 C0947630 C0002760 C1269528 C0426765 C0193036 C0426763 C0426766 C0554398 C0558058 C0728774 C0031843 C0947630 C0034394 C1706422 C3836256 C3836250 C3836251 C3836252 C3836254 C3836255 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0947630 C0013893 C0031809 C0030797 C0728774 C2825543 C2053594 C0199900 C2702329 C1697779 C0004933 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C0814472 C0031809 C1509143 C3272557 C1552839 C0947630 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0011209 C2053584 C0308779 C1390948 C1314680 C1552839 C0566690 C2114516 C1541822 C2094780 C0043246 C0332821 C0333525 C0558143 C0014586 C0043240 C0374711 C0233697 C2936643 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1552839 C0004933 C0566690 C2114516 C1541822 C2094780 C0043246 C0332821 C0333525 C0558143 C0014586 C0031809 C1509143 C3272557 C0043240 C0374711 C0200045 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C1552839 C0728774 C2228755 C0374190 C0199900 C0441587 C0035139 C0003461 C1409894 C1815293 C0034394 C1706422 C3836256 C3836250 C3836251 C3836252 C3836254 C3836255 C1552839 C2825543 C2053594 C0947630 C0031809 C2228755 C0374190 C0200045 C0003461 C2825543 C2053594 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0033150 C1555709 C1948032 C0566690 C1541822 C2114516 C0521276 C0011209 C2053584 C0308779 C1390948 C1314680 C0042232 C0750103 C2053598 C1148461 C0011209 C2053584 C0308779 C1390948 C1314680 C0016533 C0042232 C0750103 C0032989 C0477823 C0566690 C2114516 C1541822 C2094780 C0481462 C0723338 C3540738 C0600116 C1299581 C1705179 C0033348 C2706915 C0243161 C0029709 C0949766 C0553651 C0204093 C1948126 C2064714 C2148126 C0028900 C1299582 C2239248 C1830410 C3858758 C0027868 C0851416 C0026848 C0852419 C0872229 C2707260 C0202673 C0026858 C0412634 C0475091 C0029709 C0949766 C0553651 C0204093 C1948126 C2064714 C2148126 C1299582 C0556050 C0007876 C0195605 C0195625 C1384674 C0157478 C0372645 C0843083 C0193211 C0021167 C0262926 C2004062 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 ", "concepts": "Physical Therapy, Physical Therapy, Chest Physical Therapy, Incontinence, Incontinence Pad, Traumas, Trauma, Trauma, Anal, Obstetrics summary, summary behavioral therapy, physical;
