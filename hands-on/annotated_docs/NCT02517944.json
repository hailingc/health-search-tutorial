{"text": "TITLE:\n      MYOCARDIAL SILENT INFARCTIONS AND FIBROSIS IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (CHOLCOEUR)\nSUMMARY:\n      Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) at high cardiovascular risk may suffer from\n      silent micro-infarctions (MI) before clinical coronary heart disease manifestations because\n      of the lifetime exposure to elevated serum LDL-cholesterol levels.\n      The study aims to demonstrate the higher prevalence of silent myocardial infarction in a\n      population of asymptomatic patients with familial hypercholesterolemia at high\n      cardiovascular risk in comparison to control patients using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance\n      sequences of delayed gadolinium enhancement.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      To demonstrate the higher prevalence of silent myocardial infarction in a population of\n      asymptomatic patients with familial hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk in\n      comparison to control patients, the protocol is the following:\n        -  to enroll 75 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)\n        -  to enroll 35 subjects without FH (control group)\n        -  for each subject, to collect data from his medical file (blood test results) and to\n           perform a cardiac and aortic MRI in order to evaluate the micro-infarction proportion.\n      The study will be performed according to GCPs and with respect with french laws.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion criteria:\n        For patients with heterozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia:\n          -  Aged between 40 and 60 years\n          -  With an identified genetic mutation (LDL-R, ApoB, PCSK9)\n          -  Asymptomatic,\n          -  With no EKG sign of ischemia\n          -  No personal history of coronary heart disease.\n          -  Treated or untreated by lipid lowering treatment\n          -  High cardiovascular risk identified by 1 of the following criteria:\n             1.

mg/dL, hypertension (BP > 140/or > 90 mmHg or drug treatment), Lp (a) \u2265 50\n             mg/dL, tendon xanthoma\n        For control subjects:\n          -  Aged between 40 and 60 years\n

normal sinus rhythm , no sign of ischemia nor Left Bundle Branch\n             Block\n          -  No personal history of coronary heart disease.\n          -  Control subjects will be matched for age/gender/smoking status and blood pressure\n        Exclusion criteria:\n          -  Non-affiliation to a healthcare system\n          -  Consent refusal\n          -  Contra-indication to MRI or
