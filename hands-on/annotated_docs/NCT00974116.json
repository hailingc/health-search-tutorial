{"text": "TITLE:\n      Trial of the MEND Childhood Obesity Treatment Program\nSUMMARY:\n      The number of children who are obese in the UK is steadily increasing with both short and\n      long term consequences for health. The aim of this study is to determine whether the MEND\n      Programme (a new national initiative for the treatment of childhood obesity) is a successful\n      and sustainable treatment for childhood obesity and obesity related health problems.\n      300 overweight and obese children will be randomly assigned to start immediately on the MEND\n      Programme for 6 months or join a waiting-list control group for 6 months. Measurements of\n      health outcomes will be taken at baseline, and at 6, 12 and 24 months after the Programme.\n      After 6 months of waiting-list time, the control group will follow the same protocol as the\n      immediate starters. The researchers will be unaware (blinded) to which group each child has\n      been assigned to. The study will examine the effects of the MEND Programme on body\n      composition, cardiovascular health and psychological health.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The Study is a Randomised Controlled Trial.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Children enrolled in the MEND Programme who are yet to be given a start date for the\n             programme.\n          -  Aged between 7-13 years old.\n          -  Overweight or obese as defined by a BMI which falls above the 91st centile on the\n             boys/girls BMI chart UK cross-sectional reference data:1997/1).\n          -  Clinically well with no known chronic illness.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Age less than 7 years or older than 13.\n          -  Known chronic illness.\n", "cuis": "C2362324 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C2728259 C0376691 C0671679 C1966209 C1552616 C1706244 C2229974 C0028754 C0221106 C0947630 C0671679 C0424093 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0028754 C1578513 C1322839 C2728259 C3854058 C4049936 C0220644 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0028754 C0033213 C2081614 C0233492 C0445356 C0220644 C0497406 C1552601 C0028754 C1552850 C0671679 C1697779 C1322839 C2728259 C3843236 C3843237 C3843238 C3843239 C1561542 C1552839 C1322839 C2728259 C1561542 C0728774 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C1561542 C1552839 C1697779 C1552839 C1552601 C0947630 C0671679 C0152338 C1322839 C2728259 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0025353 C3887460 C0007220 C0436125 C0497234 C0486616 C1555710 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C2911690 C0180112 C0947630 C1966209 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C3244317 C1552850 C0671679 C1322839 C2728259 C0497406 C0028754 C0085639 C1514811 C1561577 C0007963 C0684240 C1552858 C0008679 C2186378 C3272565 C3845898 C0243161 C1114365 C1555709 C1948032 C0008679 C2186378 ", "concepts": "Childhood Obesity, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Program, Programs, mend, Triall summary, summary number of children, obese, increasing ph study, mend initiative, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, obesity, new, Programmer, Program, donation, Donation, childhood HD Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, obesity, problem, problem:, elated, Unrelated, childhood HD overweight, assigned, obese, start, mend, immediate Programmer, Program, Measurement 4, Measurement 3, Measurement 2, Measurement 1, month, groups Programmer, Program, month, Vaseline Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, month, groups immediate, groups assigned, study, mend, body, Programmer, Program, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined psychological health, cardiovascular, cardiovascular drug, cardiovascular exam, Pain;cardiovascular, compositions, composition description, prescription, prescription Controlled, Controller, Study, Triall criteria, Eligibility Criteria given, start, mend, Programmer, Program Overweight, obese, falls reference, Reference, chart, chart, section chronic illnesses, chronic illness, Clinical, Uknown Criteria Age, folder, Folder chronic illnesses, chronic illness "}
