{"text": "TITLE:\n      Efficacy of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) in Persons Receiving Botulinum Neurotoxin for Upper Extremity Spasticity\nSUMMARY:\n      FES is a form of treatment with a device to aid movement in people who have had damage to\n      their brain or spinal cord. Small electrical impulses are used to excite/stimulate the\n      nerves that supply paralyzed muscles. This activates those muscles, enabling them to produce\n      basic but useful movement. Self-adhesive patches (electrodes) are placed on the skin close\n      to the nerve that supplies the muscle and are connected by wires to a stimulator that\n      produces the impulses. In this way, FES is used to correct the muscle weakness that is\n      caused by injury to the brain or spinal cord.\n      Repetitive task practice is an \"activity-based\" therapy program that has been shown to\n      enhance the recovery of hand and arm functions after stroke. This therapy consists of a set\n      of training activities that are designed by a qualified therapist specific to your\n      functional abilities that are to be performed with the impaired hand. These activities are\n      designed to stimulate functional improvement with repetitive practice.\n      Spasticity is a nervous system disorder where certain muscles are continuously contracted.\n      Botox injections are commonly used to help to reduce spasticity in areas of the body with\n      increased muscle tone. This research is designed to look at any additional benefit that may\n      occur when Botox injections are combined with specific occupational therapy exercises and\n      with a device that uses functional electrical stimulation (FES) to help improve muscle\n      function after stroke.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial examining the effect of repetitive\n      task practice (RTP) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) in individuals who receive\n      routine clinical Botox \u00ae injections for upper extremity spasticity. Botox\u00ae injections in\n      combination with repetitive task practice (RTP) is used routinely to manage upper limb\n      spasticity after stroke or acquired brain injury. RTP is an activity-based rehabilitation\n      program that has been shown effective in promoting motor recovery (Wolf et al., 2002), but\n      it requires a sufficient level of baseline motor function. Since FES enhances motor\n      function, we hypothesize that an FES-assisted RTP intervention will provide greater\n      improvement in hand function than RTP alone in patients receiving Botox \u00ae injections.\n      The primary outcome will be upper extremity use during activities of daily living assessed\n      observationally by the motor activities log (MAL-O). Secondary outcomes will be 1) dexterous\n      hand function as measured by the action research arm test (ARAT); 2) client's perception of\n      self-performance in activities of daily living assessed with the (MAL - Self Report); 3)\n      global upper extremity impairment assessed by the Chedoke-McMaster Assessment (CMA); and 4)\n      clinical spasticity assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).\n      The primary endpoint will be 6 weeks post-injection. Outcomes will also be assessed at a\n      secondary endpoint, 12 weeks post-injection, to determine the persistence of treatment\n      effects.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Minimum 6 months post injury/insult with unilateral upper limb spasticity of the\n             elbow, wrist and/or finger flexors.\n          -  Preinjection Modified Ashworth scores > 2 in at least one of the following areas:\n             elbow, wrist, or finger flexors.\n          -  Subjects must meet criteria for CMA Hand Impairment Scale Stage 2 and be able to\n             complete Task 3 (thumb to index finger) of the CMA Hand Impairment Scale Stage 3, or\n             demonstrate 50% gross grasp to be included.\n          -  Botulinum toxin A (Botox\u00ae) stable patients (have received at least two prior doses of\n             the agent with first dose occurring at least 6 months prior to study enrollment).\n          -  Able to answer reliably to yes/no questions.\n          -  Able to follow reliably 1-step instructions.\n          -  Written informed consent.\n          -  Females enrolled in this study who are of childbearing age will be required to use\n             adequate measures of birth control for the entire study period.
