A retrospective patient chart review will then be\n      performed and patient data will be collected to document patient characteristics and actual\n      treatment outcomes. Upon qualification, specific instructions for chart review will be\n      provided. Once the identified charts are pulled, the physicians are instructed to continue\n      with the on-line survey.
