{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effects of L-thyroxine Replacement on Serum Lipid and Atherosclerosis in Hypothyroidism\nSUMMARY:\n      Hypothyroidism is a common clinical entity which is often complicated by dyslipidemia. It is\n      also reported increased risk for incidence of atherosclerosis and resulting coronary heart\n      disease(CHD), heart failure(HF) and cardiovascular(CV) death. The effect of L-thyroxine\n      replacement treatment on serum lipid and atherosclerosis is controversial in hypothyroid\n      patients, especially in those with mild or moderate subclinical hypothyroidism. The present\n      study was designed to investigate whether L-thyroxine replacement was effective in improving\n      serum lipid profiles and retarding atherosclerosis progress.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  40~75 years old\n          -  Diagnosis of overt or subclinical hypothyroidism in two occasions with a minimum\n             interval period of three months\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Pregnant or lactating women\n          -  Severe hepatic or renal dysfunction\n          -  Psychiatric disabilities, acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, chronic\n             respiratory diseases, familiar hypercholesterolemia, malignancy, cholelithiasis,\n             pancreatitis, bowel diseases and other disorders influencing lipid and bile acid\n             metabolism\n          -  Taking lipid-lowering agents and other drugs influencing thyroid function, lipid and\n             bile acid metabolism\n          -  Obviously poor compliance.\n", "cuis": "C0004153 C0004155 C0017327 C0455407 C0029899 C1611706 C0150988 C0029696 C0333494 C0020676 C0577643 C0079691 C0040165 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C0229671 C1546774 C1550100 C0523744 C1552616 C1706244 C0020676 C0577643 C0242339 C0020473 C3245511 C3272565 C0004153 C0029899 C1611706 C0150988 C0029696 C0333494 C0700287 C1549114 C0684224 C0018787 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C0079691 C0040165 C0018787 C0011065 C1306577 C3887460 C0004153 C0029899 C1611706 C0150988 C0029696 C0333494 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C0428462 C0020676 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0271790 C1998045 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C0079691 C0040165 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C0947630 C0004153 C0029899 C1611706 C0150988 C0029696 C0333494 C0428462 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0271790 C1998045 C0011900 C0945731 C0025344 C1561542 C1552654 C1552713 C0243161 C0549206 C2828358 C3668831 C0205054 C1547227 C1547231 C1561581 C4050465 C4050466 C0264097 C0022646 C0277785 C0007820 C0393949 C0585890 C0810006 C0553766 C3887460 C0007220 C0436125 C0497234 C0231170 C1548428 C3526598 C0020443 C1522133 C0678189 C0475700 C1392499 C0008350 C0006826 C1306459 C3842363 C0012634 C0042497 C0087153 C2266627 C1546767 C0021831 C0030305 C1963198 C0012634 C0007222 C0017178 C0005388 C0523744 C0025519 C3822292 C2242456 C0040130 C0013227 C1820370 C0523744 C0025519 C3822292 C0005388 C0032646 ", "concepts": "Atherosclerosis, NOS, Atherosclerosis NEC, Atherosclerosis NOS, FH: Atherosclerosis, Otosclerosis, Myosclerosis, Acrosclerosis, Other otosclerosis, Venosclerosis, Hypothyroidism, NOS, FH: Hypothyroidism, L-thyroxine, thyroxine, replacement, Replacement, placement, Serums, Serum, Serum, Lipids summary, summary Hypothyroidism, NOS, FH: Hypothyroidism, dyslipidemia, lipidemia, common, Clinical atherosclerosis, Otosclerosis, Myosclerosis, Acrosclerosis, Other otosclerosis, Venosclerosis, Reported, Unreported, Reported, heart, CK increased, LH increased, PT increased, QT increased, pH increased, GH increased, increased mg, CI increased, Na increased, K+ increased, Zn increased, T4 increased, T3 increased L-thyroxine, thyroxine, heart, deaths, death, cardiovascular atherosclerosis, Otosclerosis, Myosclerosis, Acrosclerosis, Other otosclerosis, Venosclerosis, replacements, Replacement, placement, serum lipid, hypothyroid, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate L-thyroxine, thyroxine, replacements, Replacement, placement, study atherosclerosis, Otosclerosis, Myosclerosis, Acrosclerosis, Other otosclerosis, Venosclerosis, serum lipid criteria, Eligibility Criteria subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, {Diagnosis}, Diagnosis period, month, Interval, Interval Criteria Pregnant, Lactating, Lactating hepatic, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Sever, renal, Dysfunction Cerebrovascular disease, NOS, Other cerebrovascular disease, H/O: cerebrovascular disease, Acute cerebrovascular disease, Diffuse cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular, cardiovascular drug, cardiovascular exam, Pain;cardiovascular, disabilities, Psychiatric, Psychiatric Hypercholesterolemia, NOS, Hypercholesterolemia, Pure hypercholesterolemia, FH: Hypercholesterolemia, cholesterolemia, cholelithiasis, malignancy, Malignancy, No malignancy, diseases, respirators, respirator, respirator, Respiratory bowel diseases, pancreatitis, Pancreatitis, disorders, CV disorders, GI disorders, bile, lipids metabolism, H2 metabolism thyroid function, thyroid function test, drugs, flowering, lipids metabolism, H2 metabolism, bile Poor compliance "}
