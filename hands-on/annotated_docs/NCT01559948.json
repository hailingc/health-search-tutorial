{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effectiveness of the Compression Belt for Patients With Sacroiliac Joint Pain\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to examine the usefulness of the addition\n      of a pelvic compression belt to a lumbopelvic stabilization program for patients with\n      sacroiliac joint pain by comparing lumbopelvic stabilization exercises with a pelvic\n      compression belt to lumbopelvic stabilization exercises alone. Outcome measures including\n      the Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index (OSW), the percentage change of TrA and\n      IO muscle thickness (i.e. muscle contraction from rest to contract) utilizing ultrasound\n      imaging, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for pain, and a subjective rating of overall\n      perceived improvement using the Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale will be collected.\n      Hypothesis: The OSW scores and NPRS scores will be lower for those who receive the\n      compression belt in addition to the lumbopelvic stabilization program as compared to those\n      who receive the lumbopelvic stabilization alone. The percent change of muscle thickness for\n      the deep abdominals as well as the GROC scores will be higher for those who receive the\n      compression belt in addition to the lumbopelvic stabilization program as compared to those\n      who receive the lumbopelvic stabilization alone.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Background: The estimated prevalence of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain is approximately 13-30%\n      in patients with non-specific low back pain. One common presentation for those with SIJ pain\n      is unilateral pain over the SIJ region, which is described as a positive Fortin's sign.\n      Common impairments for this population include pelvic asymmetry, lumbopelvic muscle\n      imbalance, and decreased lumbopelvic proprioceptive awareness and stability. Two common\n      physical therapy interventions for this population are lumbopelvic stabilization programs\n      and pelvic compression belts. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to examine\n      the usefulness of the addition of a pelvic compression belt to a lumbopelvic stabilization\n      program for patients with sacroiliac joint pain by comparing lumbopelvic stabilization\n      exercises with a pelvic compression belt to lumbopelvic stabilization exercises alone.\n      Participants: Thirty participants with unilateral pain near the SIJ will be recruited for\n      the study and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (stabilization plus belt or\n      stabilization alone). Both groups will receive a lumbopelvic stabilization program for 12\n      weeks. The stabilization plus belt group will also receive a pelvic compression belt to be\n      worn continuously for the first 4 weeks. Outcome measures including the Modified Oswestry\n      Low Back Pain Disability Index (OSW), the percentage change of TrA and IO muscle thickness\n      (i.e. muscle contraction from rest to contract) utilizing ultrasound imaging, the Numeric\n      Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for pain, and a subjective rating of overall perceived improvement\n      using the Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale will be collected. These outcomes will be\n      assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 3 months post-intervention. Hypothesis: The OSW scores\n      and NPRS scores will be lower for those who receive the compression belt in addition to the\n      lumbopelvic stabilization program as compared to those who receive the lumbopelvic\n      stabilization alone. The percent change of muscle thickness for the deep abdominals as well\n      as the GROC scores will be higher for those who receive the compression belt in addition to\n      the lumbopelvic stabilization program as compared to those who receive the lumbopelvic\n      stabilization alone. Data Analysis: Two separate ANOVAs (group x time) with repeated\n      measures will be used to examine the effect of the interventions on disability and the\n      percent change of muscle thickness. Whitney U-test will be used to analyze the NPRS data,\n      and descriptive statistics will be used to report the GROC scores. Clinical Relevance: The\n      results of the study may provide evidence in prescribing pelvic compression belt for those\n      with SIJ pain. It will also offer guidance as to how and when pelvic compression belts\n      should be used in this population. Finally, it will guide physical therapists in prescribing\n      effective interventions for those with SIJ pain.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  unilateral pain near the sacroiliac joint that does not extend pass the knee\n          -
