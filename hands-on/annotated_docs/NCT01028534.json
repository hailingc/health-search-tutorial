{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effects of Antihypertensive Drugs in Patients With Hypertension and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)\nSUMMARY:\n      The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of different types of\n      antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin II receptor blockers and long-acting calcium channel\n      blockers) in patients with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea who are not controlled\n      well with their hypertension after continuous positive airway pressure therapy.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension have a significant interrelationship, and\n      both disorders are well known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Treating them\n      appropriately may improve the prognosis of the patients. Presently, continuous positive\n      airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the first-line therapy for OSA, and angiotensin II\n      receptor blockers and long-acting calcium channel blockers for hypertension in Japan.\n      Therefore, in the present study, we wanted to compare the effects of these different types\n      of antihypertensive drugs on the control of blood pressure in patients with OSA whose\n      hypertension is not controlled well after CPAP therapy.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Apnea and hypopnea index of more than 20 /hr, and treated with CPAP\n          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure of more than 130 mmHg\n             or diastolic blood pressure of more than 80 mmHg\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Cerebrovascular diseases, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or heart failure\n             within 6 months\n          -  Uncontrolled arrhythmia\n          -  Severe hepatic or renal disorders\n          -  Having poor prognosis disorders such as malignant disorders\n", "cuis": "C0520679 C0003364 C0020538 C1963138 C3248638 C0947663 C0085580 C0455405 C1696708 C3829824 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C0003364 C0003009 C0373546 C0523498 C0003018 C0051863 C0051887 C0051889 C0603886 C0006675 C1979715 C0520679 C3248634 C2013985 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0180112 C2911690 C0199451 C0454519 C2359935 C3872512 C2960045 C2359936 C0454518 C3476394 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0087111 C0033972 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0520679 C3248634 C3472692 C3472696 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0042373 C0558373 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0012634 C0017178 C3845898 C0033325 C3854082 C1444662 C1514241 C1708063 C0428719 C1320796 C0003009 C0373546 C0523498 C0003018 C0051863 C0051887 C0051889 C0603886 C0087111 C0033972 C0006684 C0872271 C0005116 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C1979715 C0947630 C1753303 C2256438 C1622937 C1749362 C0003364 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0087111 C0033972 C0180112 C2911690 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0235546 C0003578 C1963065 C0918012 C0770655 C0332155 C1868885 C0871470 C1306620 C0488055 C0277884 C0428883 C0488052 C1305849 C1319895 C0277882 C1277632 C2039694 C1282149 C1282150 C1282151 C1282174 C1319893 C2039700 C4071677 C0277883 C0428882 C1303018 C1840374 C2039699 C2133958 C0428883 C1305849 C0488052 C0277890 C0277889 C0488055 C0871470 C1306620 C1319896 C0277887 C1277633 C2183311 C1282161 C1282162 C1282163 C1282175 C1319894 C2183315 C0802999 C4071678 C0277888 C0428885 C1303019 C1840375 C2133960 C2183314 C0243161 C0007820 C0393949 C0585890 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727 C2348362 C1168331 C0455406 C0340324 C1998297 C0340312 C0340325 C0428950 C2825159 C0002962 C0455530 C0018801 C0018802 C1561542 C0003811 C0861148 C0857250 C0022658 C0001621 C0003462 C0598364 C0205054 C1547227 C1547231 C1561581 C4050465 C4050466 C0264097 C0278252 C0012634 C0007222 C0017178 C0032927 ", "concepts": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Antihypertensive Drugs, Hypertension NOS, Hypertension, Hypertension mg, Hypertensin, Hypertension NOS, FH: Hypertension, Pre-Hypertension, Has Hypertension, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary study antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin ii, Angiotensin II, Angiotensin I, angiotensin, SMT-angiotensin II, NAB angiotensin II, Br5-angiotensin II, SAMP-angiotensin II, calcium, H2 receptor blockers obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, Obstructive sleep apnea mg, organic obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, Hypertension, Prehypertensions, No hypertension, hypertensin, controllers, Controlled continuous positive airway pressure ventilation, Periodic continuous positive airway pressure, Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), Home continuous positive airway pressure unit, Continuous positive airway pressure titration, Continuous positive airway pressure attachment, Intermittent continuous positive airway pressure, Pressure.continuous positive airway.95%, hypertension, Hypertension, Prehypertensions, No hypertension, hypertensin, therapy, Cotherapy description, prescription, prescription OSA -
