{"text": "TITLE:\n      Comparison of the FemoSeal\u00ae Arterial Closure Device to Manual Compression After Coronary Angiography\nSUMMARY:\n      Is the FemoSeal\u00ae closure device safer and more comfortable than manual compression for\n      femoral artery access closure after coronary angiography?\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Access site complication after coronary angiography is still a challenge in everyday\n      practice. The FemoSeal\u00ae closure device has proven very safe as shown in the swedish SCAAR\n      registry. This study is aimed to investigate, in a randomized design, if the FemoSeal\u00ae has\n      an advantage in safety and efficacy over manual compression.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  The patient must be at least 18 years old\n          -  Patients undergoing femoral access coronary angiography\n          -  Patient must be competent for providing informed, written consent\n          -  Only 6F sheath\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Percutaneous coronary intervention\n          -  Intra coronary measurements (FFR, IVUS, OCT, NIR)\n          -  Groin hematoma before closure\n          -  Pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula\n          -  Significant stenosis of ilial or femoral artery\n          -  Prior peripheral artery surgery\n          -  INR > 3,0\n          -  Platelet count < 120 million per millilitre blood\n          -  Coagulopathy (bleeding disorder)\n          -  Thrombolysis in the last 24h\n          -  Planned heparin infusion after the procedure\n          -  Pregnancy\n          -  Uncontrolled hypertension > 200 mmHg / 110 mmHg\n          -  Femoral access device closure in the last 30 days\n", "cuis": "C0085532 C1548829 C0565514 C4049863 C0003842 C0185003 C0025080 C3887560 C0027873 C0024763 C3891067 C1552616 C1706244 C0565514 C0021153 C1829459 C4049863 C0024763 C2712134 C0085532 C1633729 C0015801 C1280173 C0226448 C1281581 C0226455 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0085532 C1633729 C0009566 C1171258 C1148100 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C0161815 C0185026 C0805586 C2347900 C2348080 C0798503 C0237607 C3245512 C0700164 C0034975 C0947630 C0565514 C0021153 C1829459 C4049863 C0024763 C0308269 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0085532 C1633729 C0015811 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0699530 C0562357 C1720467 C0243161 C1532338 C4049682 C4049683 C4034923 C4049680 C4049681 C1532297 C1320647 C4037588 C0018787 C0423103 C2048307 C3838520 C0585249 C1510412 C0162868 C1543161 C0015801 C1280173 C0226448 C1281581 C0226455 C1261287 C0489868 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0032181 C1287267 C0392386 C0857460 C0005768 C0229664 C0005779 C1458140 C0854145 C0455495 C0520997 C0733564 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0574032 C0854643 C0019134 C0770546 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C1868885 C0015811 C3842337 ", "concepts": "Coronary Angiographies, Coronary Angiography, Compression, Impression, Arterial, Closure, Device, Devices, Devic, Manual, Manual summary, summary compression, decompression, Decompression, Impression, manual, Comfortable coronary angiogram, Coronary angiogram, femoral arteries, Femoral artery, Left femoral artery, Left femoral artery, Deep femoral artery description, prescription, prescription coronary angiogram, Coronary angiogram, Complications, complications, NB complication, Complications, IUD complication, IUD complication, CNS complication, plication, challenges, Rechallenge, Dechallenge, Challenge practices, practice, proven registry, study compression, decompression, Decompression, Impression, manual, Advantage criteria, Eligibility Criteria coronary angiogram, Coronary angiogram, femoral, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, providine, Uninformed Only Criteria Percutaneous coronary intervention (procedure), Percutaneous coronary intervention panel, Percutaneous coronary intervention panel, Percutaneous coronary intervention report, Percutaneous coronary intervention device panel, Percutaneous coronary intervention device panel, Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention, History of percutaneous coronary intervention, Percutaneous coronary intervention Study report coronary, Eye measurements, ICD measurements, arm measurements Groin hematoma Pseudoaneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, AV fistula US femoral arteries, Femoral artery, Left femoral artery, Left femoral artery, Deep femoral artery, stenosis peripheral artery, surgery, surgery, surgery: platelet counts, platelet count, Platelet count low, Platelet count high, blood, blood Coagulopathy, Bleeding disorders, Feeding disorder, H/O: bleeding disorder Thrombolysis, Thrombolysin Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure, infusion, Reinfusion, heparins, heparin pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
