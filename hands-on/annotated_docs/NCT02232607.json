{"text": "TITLE:\n      Efficacy and Safety of Lacidipine in Chronic Stable Angina\nSUMMARY:\n      The aim of this study was to explore whether lacidipine at doses of 2 mg, 4 mg and 6 mg\n      decreased the symptoms of angina, compared to placebo in patients with chronic stable angina\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Age 18 to 80 years\n          -  History of stable, exertional angina pectoris (Canadian Cardiovascular Society\n             functional class II to III) for at least 3 months duration prior to enrolment in the\n             study\n          -  Patients not currently receiving treatment with antianginal medication (other than\n             short-acting nitrates)\n          -  Between visits 2 and 3 two treadmill exercise tests, demonstrating \u2265 0.1 mV of\n             horizontal or down sloping ST-segment depression, must be carried out. The difference\n             in symptom-limited exercise duration between these two tests must not exceed 20%\n          -  Total treadmill exercise duration > 3 minutes (i.e. stage 2 or above on a standard\n             Bruce protocol)\n          -  Coronary artery disease, preferably (not mandatory) documented by a history of proven\n             myocardial infarction and/or coronary angiography indicating \u2265 50% reduction in\n             luminal diameter of one or more coronary arteries or their primary branches\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to enrolment in the study\n          -  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass\n             surgery within 6 months\n          -  Other types of angina (variant, unstable)\n          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg or diastolic blood\n             pressure > 100 mmHg)\n          -  Resting heart rate < 50 bpm or > 100 bpm\n          -  Significant valvular heart disease\n          -  Heart failure New York Heart Association Class III or IV\n          -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma with clinical symptoms requiring\n             regular medication\n          -  Significant arrhythmia (since this may interfere with the interpretation of the\n             electrocardiogram) including Wolff Parkinson-White syndrome, atrial fibrillation,\n             atrial flutter, sick sinus syndrome, significant Atrio-Ventricular heart block,\n             intraventricular conduction defect (QRS > 0.12 seconds) ventricular pre-excitation,\n             bundle branch block, the presence of a pace-maker, the presence of an implanted\n             automatic defibrillator, uncorrected hypokalaemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/litre)\n          -  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus\n          -  Significant liver disease (Aspartate Aminotransferase or Alanine Aminotransferase >\n             twice the upper limit of reference range)\n          -  Significant renal disease (creatinine > 1.5 x upper limit of reference range)\n          -  Any clinical condition which in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the\n             safe fulfilment of the protocol and the safe administration of trial medication\n          -  Inability to perform repeated exercise testing due to extra-cardiac reasons\n          -  Concomitant treatment with any other anti-anginal medication, whether or not\n             prescribed for this indication (e.g. calcium channel blockers, \u03b2-blockers or\n             long-acting nitrates)\n          -  Concomitant treatment with anti-arrhythmic medication, digitalis or tricyclic\n             anti-depressants or other agents known to affect ST-segment morphology\n          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the investigational drug\n          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of child bearing potential\n          -  Participation in any other clinical trial within 2 months of enrolment\n          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse\n", "cuis": "C0340288 C0064568
