{"text": "TITLE:\n      Comparison of a Tissue Perfusion Guided Hemodynamic Protocol With a Standard Hemodynamic Protocol in Septic Shock Patients\nSUMMARY:\n      The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published 2008 revised guidelines to improve survival of\n      septic shock patients. For hemodynamic stabilization the SSC recommends distinct treatment\n      goals. The study hypothesis is that a tissue perfusion guided protocol could reduce the\n      duration on vasopressor treatment compared to a conventional protocol.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Background\n      Septic shock is a frequent and severe entity with a mortality of 55%. The Surviving Sepsis\n      Campaign (SSC) published 2008 revised guidelines to improve survival of septic shock\n      patients.\n      For hemodynamic stabilization the SSC recommends as treatment goals a mean arterial blood\n      pressure > 65mmHg (MAP), a central venous blood pressure of 8-12 mmHg, a mixed venous oxygen\n      saturation >65%, a central venous oxygen saturation > 70% and a diuresis > 0.5 ml/kg/h (1).\n      According to the SSC guidelines a MAP > 65 mmHg should be aimed because at this blood\n      pressure level tissue perfusion is preserved. This is based on a study in ten septic shock\n      patients where norepinephrine was titrated to three levels (65, 75 and 85 mmHg) and the\n      authors concluded that parameters of tissue perfusion did not differ between the each level\n      (2).\n      Objective\n      To evaluate if a hemodynamic protocol guided by parameters of tissue perfusion could reduce\n      the duration of vasopressor treatment in septic shock patients.\n      Methods\n      Patients suffering from septic shock requiring vasopressor support are randomly assigned to\n      a control group (usual care) and an intervention group (tissue perfusion guided protocol).\n      In the intervention group parameters of tissue perfusion are used to guide hemodynamic\n      therapy.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  2 or more SIRS criteria according to ACCP/SCCM definition\n          -  Documented infection or strong suspicion of infection with adequate antibiotic\n             treatment\n          -  Shock according to ACCP/SCCM definition with the necessity of vasopressor treatment\n        Exclusion Criteria\n          -  Patients admitted with central nervous diseases\n          -  ST elevation myocardial infarction\n          -  Pulmonary embolism\n          -  Out of hospital cardiac arrest patients\n          -  Patients with therapy limitations\n          -  Known
