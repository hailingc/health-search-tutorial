{"text": "TITLE:\n      LigaSure Small Jaw\u00ae Versus Conventional Neck Dissection in Head and Neck Cancer Patients\nSUMMARY:\n      There were totally 41 patients enrolled in the end of the study. The study group consisted\n      of 20 patients while the control group had 21 patients. The operation duration was shorter\n      (97.1 versus 116.3 minutes, P = 0.022) and the average amount of injected analgesics was\n      lower (8.8 versus 17.7 ampules, P = 0.037) in the study group. No significant differences\n      were noted between the two groups in demographic variables, primary tumor site, clinical N\n      stage, levels of neck dissection, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative drainage\n      amount/duration, and subjective postoperative pain status.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      We compared the differences in perioperative and postoperative variables between LigaSure\n      Small Jaw\u00ae-assisted and conventional neck dissection in head and neck cancer patients.\n      Patients who were scheduled to undergo neck dissection due to head and neck cancer were\n      eligible for this study. After receiving a detailed explanation, all patients signed an\n      informed consent form before randomization. The study group were treated using the LigaSure\n      vessel sealing system (Small Jaw\u00ae; Covidien, Colorado, USA) for dissection and hemostasis\n      throughout the whole procedures during neck dissection. Relevant data included tumor-related\n      variables, perioperative parameters, postoperative drainage status, postoperative subjective\n      pain, and analgesic consumption amount were recorded and analyzed.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients aged 20 to 80 years scheduled to receive neck dissection due to head and\n             neck cancer\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  history of coagulation disorders\n          -  prior radiation to the neck\n          -  prior neck dissection\n          -  declined to participate\n", "cuis": "C0278996 C0398395 C0022359 C1273020 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C1328018 C1552839 C0543467 C3244306 C0035110 C0949626 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C1552839 C0002771 C0015838 C0886384 C0179031 C0947630 C1552839 C0085632 C0677930 C1552839 C3272565 C0398395 C0019080 C0012621 C2926602 C0013103 C1300072 C1135564 C2024161 C0030201 C2215257 C2266644 C2979880 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C2024161 C0085632 C0278996 C0398395 C0022359 C1273020 C0278996 C0398395 C0086960 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0681841 C1561610 C2090600 C0947630 C0009797 C0947630 C1552839 C0332155 C0012737 C0333288 C0740166 C0005847 C0022359 C1273020 C0398395 C0025664 C0184661 C0027651 C3245479 C0233492 C0445356 C2266644 C2979880 C0012621 C2926602 C0013103 C0449381 C2024161 C0002771 C0015838 C0728960 C0002766 C0344307 C0051811 C0030193 C1947907 C4071751 C0182913 C0179038 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0398395 C0018670 C0152336 C0086960 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0746787 C0243161 C0005779 C0262926 C2004062 C0027530 C2137077 C1522449 C1524020 C1963223 C0398395 ", "concepts": "Head and Neck Cancer, Neck Dissection, Jaw, Jaw, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary study, Therex, groups operation, operations, reoperation, Reoperation, Induration, Duration, Duration, groups analgesics, nalgesic, 5 minutes ampules, study, groups, Indifference primary tumor, groups, Clinical neck dissection, bleeding, Drainage, Drainage, Drainage, stage, intraoperative MRI, postoperative VSD postoperative pain, Acute postoperative pain, subjective, Subjective, Induration, Duration, Duration description, prescription, prescription postoperative VSD, Indifference head and neck cancer, neck dissection, Jaw, Jaw head and neck cancer, neck dissection, schedule, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient explanation, signed, signed:, study informed consent form, study, groups, untreated dissections, Dissection, hemostasis, vessel, Jaw, Jaw neck dissection, procedures, Procedures, tumor, data, elated, Unrelated subjective, Subjective, Drainage, Drainage, Drainage, Parameters, postoperative VSD Analgesic, nalgesic, Analgesic, analgesia, analgesia, analgesin, pain, Consumption, O2 consumption, recorder, analyzer criteria, Eligibility Criteria neck dissection, head, head, schedule, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient neck cancer Criteria coagulation disorders, history, history neck, neck, Radiation, Radiation, Radiation neck dissection "}
