{"text": "TITLE:\n      The Use of Virtual Reality for the Gait Training of Elderly Fallers\nSUMMARY:\n      The study aims to investigate the efficacy of gait training using virtual reality to\n      decrease the risk of falls in elderly idiopathic fallers. The investigator hypothesize that\n      training with virtual reality would increase the ability to perform in the \"real world\"\n      environment and decrease the risk of falls in elderly adults.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The study is a prospective single-blinded randomized control study with repeated measures at\n      pre intervention, post intervention and follow up at 3 and 6 months post intervention. For\n      six months after termination of the intervention, all subjects will fill out a log book in\n      which they will write the occurrence and date of falls. total time of participation in the\n      study will be 8 months.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  between the ages of 65-85\n          -  independent in activities of daily living\n          -  able to walk without assistance for at least 10 minutes\n          -  cognitively intact (Mini Mental State Exam \u226524)\n          -  reported 2 or more falls within 6 months prior to the beginning of the study\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  any neurological, orthopedic or any other impairment likely to impact gait.\n          -  severe visual impairments\n          -  major depression as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\n             Disorders (DSM) criteria\n", "cuis": "C1554161 C0016928 C1947944 C1552616 C1706244 C0085673 C1553497 C0947630 C1268740 C1553497 C0442694 C1554161 C1268740 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0087136 C0723338 C0947630 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1561542 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0006002 C1148554 C1549081 C1561542 C0600109 C0085639 C0947630 C1561542 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C2242847 C0451239 C0509063 C0203978 C0451039 C0451227 C3694100 C0582381 C3484221 C4034307 C1387108 C3649805 C1299583 C0599749 C0011546 C0439857 C1299581 C1280910 C3845579 C0582103 C2328206 C1951419 C0700287 C1549114 C0684224 C0085639 C0947630 C1561542 C0243161 C0684336 C3845945 C2598156 C0016928 C2707261 C3845870 C1301509 C0599833 C1269683 C0270455 C2328206 C0012634 C0243161 C0599833 ", "concepts": "Training, Gait, Use summary, summary gait training, virtual, study risk of falls virtual, Straining, Training risk of falls description, prescription, prescription single, singlet, study interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, month interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, book, determination, Termination, month, will find falls study, month criteria, Eligibility Criteria activities of daily living (history), Katz activities of daily living, rnrx activities of daily living, Teach activities of daily living, Brief activities of daily living, Index of activities of daily living, activities of daily living goals, Assess activities of daily living, Activities of daily living score, Activities of daily living panel, training; activities of daily living, change in activities of daily living, independent, independency, dependency, dependence able, assistances, 5-10 minutes Exam, Mentale, Statex Reported, Unreported, Reported, falls, study, month Criteria impairment, No impairment, Impairments, gait, Neurological, ICU.neurological severe visual impairment Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, major depression, Mild major depression, Mentale Disorders, criteria, dsm "}
