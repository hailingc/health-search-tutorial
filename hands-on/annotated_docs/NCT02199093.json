 Voluntary participation.\n          -  The neurologist, the occupational therapist and the patient judge the intervention to\n             be necessary.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  History of apraxia before current stroke.\n          -  Stroke had occurred less than two months or more than twenty four month ago.\n          -  Cognitive impairment (< 23 in normal school population and < 20 points with a low\n             education or illiteracy, in Spanish validation of Mini-Mental State Examination\n             (MMSE)).\n          -  Severe aphasia.\n          -  Previous brain tumour.\n          -  History of other previous neurologic disorders.\n          -  Mother tongue different to Spanish.\n          -  Drugs addiction.\n          -  Intellectual or learning disorders.\n          -  Brain damage for traumatism or neurodegenerative process.\n          -  A history of serious consciousness impairments\n          -  Uncooperativeness, presence of orthopedic or other disabling disorders.\n", "cuis": "C0034991 C0007237 C0018459 C0080102 C0204601 C0728952 C3534574 C1140618 C0003635 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1705273 C1552616 C1706244 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0947630 C0179038 C0421456 C0034991 C0007237 C1140618 C0153664 C1269078 C0087111 C0033972 C0003635 C0038454 C1552839 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0027765 C0042075 C2015799 C1112108 C0003635 C0699809 C0520966 C0242414 C0026649 C0463747 C0162340 C3542413 C0221163 C0153664 C1140618 C1269078 C3245488 C0003635 C0006111 C0699809 C0026649 C0015385 C0561942 C0886296 C1948041 C1273869 C2979881 C2183254 C0012634 C3245479 C0034991 C0007237 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0947630 C1318464 C1547993 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0038454 C1304680 C1561542 C1513302 C1547225 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C0153664 C1140618 C1269078 C0003635 C1561542 C0003635 C0430054 C0183185 C3843322 C3844363 C3543419 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1318464 C0422272 C1659565 C0243161 C0262926 C2004062 C0003635 C0038454 C0038454 C1561542 C0338656 C1270972 C1839000 C3808641 C0009241 C1553386 C1550472 C0031809 C0582103 C0020899 C0424927 C0013658 C2328206 C1951419 C0003537 C1547227 C1547231 C1561581 C4050465 C4050466 C0264097 C0006118 C0027765 C0042075 C0262926 C2004062 C0557072 C0085281 C0013227 C3687832 C0023186 C0006434 C2981149 C0270611 C1456496 C0009791 C0234421 C0041657 C0517960 C3825622 C0751055 C0262926 C2004062 C0684336 C2598156 C0012634 C0007222 C0017178 C0392148 C3639369 ", "concepts": "Rehabilitation, NOS, rehabilitation, habilitation, Rehabilitation NEC, Drug Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation;drug, Lung Rehabilitation, Upper Limb, Apraxia, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Function summary, summary interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, study, analyzer, occupation: rehabilitation, rehabilitation, Upper limb, Upper limb, Upper limb, therapy, Cotherapy, apraxia stroke, groups, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol description, prescription, prescription neurologic disorder, Urological disorder, other neurological disorders, Neurological disorders NEC, Apraxia, carry Incoordination, Coordination, Movements, Suspensory systems comprehension, Comprehension motor disorders, Upper limb, upper limb, Upper limb, acquired, apraxia brain disease, carried, Movements limbs, Climbs intervention, Intervention, Intervention, Interventions, interventional, disorder, data rehabilitation, rehabilitation, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, studies Occupational Therapies, Occupational Therapy criteria, Eligibility Criteria stroke, attack, month, Mild, Mild, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate Upper limb, upper limb, Upper limb, apraxia, month Apraxia, Screen, Screens, Less than 35, Less than 55 Voluntary interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, occupational therapy, Seen by occupational therapist, Consult;occupational therapist Criteria History, History, apraxia, stroke Stroke, month cognitive impairments, Cognitive impairment, mild, Cognitive impairment (CVS+), Cognitive impairment (rare), Cognitive Impairment, normal, low examination, Examination, illiteracy, Education, Education, Mentale, Statex aphasia, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Sever brain tumour neurologic disorders, urologic disorders, History, History Mother tongue addiction, Drugs, Drugs learning disorder, burning disorders, Intellect brain damage, Brain damage consciousness, Consciousnesses, Unconsciousness, Consciousness, Subconsciousness, Semiconsciousness, history, history, impairment, Impairments disorders, CV disorders, GI disorders, presence, BPR01-Uncooperativeness "}
