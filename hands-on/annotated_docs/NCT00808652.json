{"text": "TITLE:\n      Prevalence and Outcome of Brachial Artery Endothelial Function in Morbidly Obese Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery\nSUMMARY:\n      The relation between obesity and ischemic heart disease (IHD) is under considerable debate.\n      The reduction in all-cause mortality and, more specifically, the reduction in\n      cardiac-related mortality seen after weight-loss surgery, may be due to regression or\n      slowing developement of subclinical IHD. Function of cells lining the arteries (endothelium)\n      is closely related to the state of IHD and its measurement can serve as a surrogate marker\n      for the existence and severity of IHD. The investigators hypothesize that the prevalence of\n      undiagnosed IHD in the morbidly obese population is high and that following surgery for\n      weight reduction there is a halt in the progression, or even a regression in its severity.\n      The study includes measurement of endothelial function before and after weight-reducing\n      surgery.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Morbidly obese patients who fulfill the NIH criteria for surgical intervention.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients deemed unfit for surgery\n          -  Pregnant women, or who are attempting conception.\n          -  Subjects with any history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting\n             surgery, coronary angiography with angioplasty and/or stenting, or any lesion > 50%\n             of the coronary artery luminal diameter, cerebrovascular accident, or peripheral\n             vascular disease with abnormal electrocardiograms and/or echocardiography.\n          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse.\n          -  Chronic liver disease.\n", "cuis": "C1456587 C0006087 C1705273 C0031843 C0028754 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1095984 C1552616 C1706244 C0151744 C1313980 C0010054 C1510446 C0264694 C0028754 C0233492 C0441610 C0684320 C0684321 C1836830 C0018787 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0424653 C1305866 C2053618 C0233492 C0445356 C1705273 C0031843 C0003842 C0397581 C0151744 C0005516 C0151744 C0233492 C0445356 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C0151744 C2983285 C1408353 C0011900 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0028754 C0151744 C1262477 C0012167 C0242656 C0684320 C0684321 C1836830 C2983285 C0031843 C1705273 C0424653 C1305866 C2053618 C0947630 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0549433 C0243161 C0028754 C0243161 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0009637 C2982736 C0549206 C0010055 C1260596 C0371563 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727 C2348362 C1168331 C0455406 C0340324 C1998297 C0340312 C0340325 C0428950 C2825159 C1961139 C0262926 C2004062 C0085532 C1633729 C0162577 C1548817 C0038257 C2348535 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0221198 C0772294 C0038454 C3536593 C0205042 C1269008 C1261082 C0545743 C0699493 C0522055 C0522054 C0042373 C0747531 C0026848 C2609253 C0015397 C0007222 C0268790 C0013516 C0183129 C0203378 C0013524 C0203379 C0221533 C0412564 C0085762 C0262926 C2004062 C0013227 C1254351 C0341439 ", "concepts": "Bariatric Surgery, Brachial Artery, Function, function, Obese, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Endothelin summary, summary ihd, FH: Ischemic heart disease, ischaemic heart disease, Acute ischemic heart disease, Chronic ischemic heart disease, obesity, elation reduction Regression, Regression, Regression, cardiac, surgery, surgery, surgery:, weight, weight, weight, elated, Unrelated Function, function, arteries, Arteries, ihd marker, ihd, elated, Unrelated, ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement ihd, Severity undiagnosed, diagnosed, surgery, surgery, surgery:, obese, ihd weight reduction, weight reduction diet, progression, Regression, Regression, Regression, Severity function, Function, weight, weight, weight, study, ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement surgery, surgery, surgery: criteria, Eligibility Criteria surgical intervention, criteria, obese Criteria surgery, surgery, surgery:, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient conception, Preconception, Pregnant Coronary artery bypass graft, coronary artery graft bypass, Coronary artery bypass/reop, Myocardial infarction, NOS, Myocardial infarction, Healed myocardial infarction, ECG: myocardial infarction, atrial myocardial infarction, Acute myocardial infarction, First myocardial infarction, septal myocardial infarction, Septal myocardial infarction, Apical myocardial infarction, FH: Myocardial infarction, Silent myocardial infarction, Recent myocardial infarction, Lateral myocardial infarction, Aborted myocardial infarction, ECG: no myocardial infarction, Date of myocardial infarction, grafting, history, history coronary angiogram, Coronary angiogram, angioplasty, Angioplasty, stenting, Stenting, surgery, surgery, surgery:, lesion, Alesion cerebrovascular accident, Chronic cerebrovascular accident, coronary arteries, Coronary artery, coronary artery left, artery coronary, luminal abnormal electrocardiograms, normal electrocardiogram, vascular diseases, perivascular disease, muscular diseases, Macrovascular disease, Ocular disease, Cardiovascular disease, Renal vascular disease, echocardiogram, echocardiographs, 3D Echocardiography, 2D Echocardiography, 4D Echocardiography, cardiography, Fetal echocardiography alcohol abuse, History, History, drug, drug Chronic liver disease "}
