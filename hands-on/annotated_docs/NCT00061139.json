{"text": "TITLE:\n      Constraint-Based Therapy to Improve Motor Function in Children With Cerebral Palsy\nSUMMARY:\n      Pediatric Constraint-Induced (CI) Movement therapy is a rehabilitation program designed to\n      improve motor function in children with partial paralysis. Children with cerebral palsy may\n      have one arm that has significantly greater function (good arm) than the other (bad arm).\n      Restricting the use of the good arm may improve the use of the bad arm. In pediatric CI\n      therapy, the good arm is put in a sling to force increased use of the bad arm. The bad arm\n      is also trained each day for several weeks. This study will test the ability of pediatric CI\n      therapy to improve motor function in children with cerebral palsy.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Cerebral palsy afflicts at least two in 1,000 children in the United States and\n      approximately 2,000,000 children worldwide. Behavioral techniques that impact the plasticity\n      of the nervous system need to be incorporated into practical, evidence-based therapeutic\n      interventions for this condition.\n      CI therapy was derived from basic research with animal and human subjects. Randomized,\n      controlled studies indicate that it can substantially reduce the motor deficit of adult\n      patients with mild to moderately severe chronic strokes and can increase their independence\n      over a period of years. CI therapy involves motor restriction of the less affected upper\n      extremity for a period of 2 to 3 weeks while concurrently training the more affected upper\n      limb. This gives rise to concentrated, repetitive use of the more affected extremity. In\n      adults, CI therapy has lead to a large increase in use-dependent cortical reorganization\n      involving the recruitment of substantial new regions of the brain in the innervation of more\n      affected extremity movement.\n      The study will evaluate CI therapy in a pediatric population. The study will test whether\n      pediatric CI therapy can promote new and improved motor behavior in young children with\n      hemiparesis associated with cerebral palsy. Pediatric CI therapy involves total restraint of\n      the unaffected upper extremity with simultaneous repetitive use of the affected extremity\n      for 6 hours/day for 21 consecutive days.\n      Fifty-two children ages 2 to 6 years old with hemiparetic cerebral palsy will be randomly\n      assigned to either the pediatric CI therapy group or to a control group. The control group\n      will receive standard rehabilitation therapy. All children will have a complete medical\n      evaluation with emphasis on motor function prior to treatment initiation. Children will\n      undergo follow-up testing at 1, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The primary study\n      assessment tools are the Pediatric Developmental Motor Scales - II (PDMS-II), DASI \u2013 II,\n      Bayley Developmental Skills Test, Pediatric Motor Activity Log (PMAL), Child Arm Use Test\n      (CAUT), and Emerging Behavior Scale (EBS).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria\n          -  Clinical diagnosis of hemiparetic cerebral palsy consistent with criteria in Swaiman\n             and Russman (1999) and Badawi et al. (1998)\n          -  Recommended for participation in pediatric rehabilitation and/or early intervention\n          -  Lives within 50 miles of the Civitan Center at University of Alabama at Birmingham or\n             the family is willing to temporarily relocate to the Birmingham area for treatment\n        Exclusion Criteria\n          -  Profound bilateral hearing loss with the use of hearing aids\n          -  Severe visual impairment\n          -  Serious seizure disorder or uncontrolled seizures\n          -  Genetic and syndromic conditions historically excluded for CP registries\n          -  Familial Spastic Paraplegia\n          -  Ataxic Cerebral Palsy\n          -  Diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disability or autism\n          -  Serious or recurring medical complications\n          -  Scheduled for surgery within 12 months of study entry\n", "cuis": "C0007789 C1705273 C0031843 C0087111 C1363945 C1510538 C1561611 C3247248 C1552616 C1706244
