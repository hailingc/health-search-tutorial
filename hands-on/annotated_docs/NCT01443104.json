{"text": "TITLE:\n      Sirolimus-eluting Stents With Biodegradable Polymer Versus an Everolimus-eluting Stents\nSUMMARY:\n      Coronary artery stents have improved the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary\n      intervention for coronary artery disease. Drug-eluting stents have been shown to decrease\n      neointimal hyperplasia and to reduce the rate of restenosis and target-lesion\n      revascularization as compared to bare-metal stents. Drug-eluting stents consist of a\n      metallic platform and a therapeutic substance that is usually released from a polymer\n      matrix. A previous study utilizing a bioresorbable polymer has demonstrated a favorable\n      safety and efficacy profile in a large-scale clinical trial as compared to a\n      first-generation druf-eluting stent (LEADERS trial).\n      The objective of the study is to compare the safety and efficacy of a sirolimus-eluting\n      stent with a biodegradable polymer with an everolimus-eluting stent with a durable polymer\n      in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial in patients\n      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in routine clinical practice.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Background\n      Coronary artery stents have improved the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary\n      interventions compared with balloon angioplasty alone (New Engl J Med 1994; 331:489-495).\n      Notwithstanding, restenosis is still encountered in 20 to 30% of lesions after implantation\n      of bare metal stents (JAMA 2000; 284:1828-36) and may require repeat revascularization\n      procedures with a negative impact on quality of life and health care expenditures.\n      Drug-eluting stents with local, controlled release of therapeutic agents have addressed this\n      problem successfully (Circulation 2003; 107:3003-7). Current drug-eluting stents consist of\n      a metallic stent platform and a therapeutic agent, which is either directly immobilized on\n      the stent surface or released from a polymer matrix. Polymers currently utilized for\n      drug-eluting stents are either biodegradable or non-biodegradable. While biodegradable\n      polymers are released together with the drug and dissolve after a certain period of time,\n      non-biodegradable polymers reside permanently on the stent surface.\n      First-generation drug-eluting stents utilized sirolimus and paclitaxel for prevention of\n      restenosis. Both drugs are highly lipophilic and show rapid and strong uptake in arterial\n      wall tissue. In addition, Sirolimus (Circulation 2001; 104:852-5) and paclitaxel\n      (Circulation 1997; 96:636-45) have been shown to reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation and\n      neointimal hyperplasia, the principal cause of restenosis after coronary stenting in\n      experimental models. A polymer-encapsulated stent releasing Sirolimus has been compared with\n      the respective bare metal stent in several randomized clinical trials, demonstrating a\n      consistent reduction in angiographic and clinical restenosis (N Engl J Med 2002;\n      346:1773-80). Similarly, a polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent consistently reduced\n      restenosis and the need for repeated revascularization procedures compared with the\n      respective bare metal stent (N Engl J Med 2004; 350:221-31). A meta-analysis of drug-eluting\n      stent trials confirmed the reduction in restenosis and repeat revascularization procedures\n      for polymer-based, drug-eluting stents (Lancet 2004; 364:583-91). Moreover, the rates of\n      death and myocardial infarction were comparable to those with bare metal stents, attesting\n      to the safety of these devices, which have been approved by the US Food and Drug\n      Administration.\n      Newer generation drug-eluting stents with durable polymer coating utilize Limus analogues\n      such as everolimus, zotarolimus or novolimus. Everolimus-eluting stents have been compared\n      to first-generation drug-eluting stents in several randomized clinical trials. A pooled\n      analysis of the four largest randomized trials to date comparing everolimus-eluting stents\n      with paclitaxel-eluting stents demonstrated a lower rate of MACE (4.4% versus 7.6%),\n      myocardial infarction (2.1% vs. 4.0%, p<0.001), ischemic TLR (2.3% vs. 4.7%, p<0.001), and\n      definite stent thrombosis (0.4% vs. 1.2%, p<0.001) in favor of EES, whereas there was no\n      difference with regard to overall and cardiac mortality (Stone GW. The XIENCE V - PROMUS\n      Everolimus-Eluting Stent: New Insights from the SPIRIT/COMPARE Meta-analysis and other\n      randomized trials. Presentation at Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics, September 22nd\n      2010). At the same time several trials comparing everolimus-eluting stents with\n      sirolimus-eluting stents reported favorable performance of everolimus-eluting stents. In a\n      randomized trial enrolling 2'774 patients everolimus-eluting stents were non-inferior\n      compared with sirolimus-eluting stents at nine months with regard to MACE (4.9% vs. 5.2%, HR\n      0.94, 0.67-1.31) and TLR (1.4% vs. 1.7%, HR 0.87, 0.48-1.58) (N Engl J Med\n      2010;362(28):1663-74). Likewise, event rates at two years were similar for\n      everolimus-eluting stents and sirolimus-eluting stents (3.7% versus 4.3%, p=0.85) in a\n      randomized controlled trial comparing EES, SES, and BMS in large vessels (stent diameter\n      >3.0 mm), whereas TVR was lower with both EES (3.7%) and SES (4.3%) as compared with\n      bare-metal stents (10.3%, P=0.005 vs SES, P=0.002 vs EES) (N Engl J Med\n      2010;363(24):2310-9). A propensity-score matched comparison of EES and SES reported lower\n      event rates of myocardial infarction (3.3% versus 5.0%, HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42-0.92, P=0.017)\n      in part due to a lower risk of stent thrombosis (definite or probable 2.5% versus 4.0%, HR\n      0.64, 95% CI 0.41-0.98, P=0.041), as well as a lower rate of target vessel revascularization\n      (7.0% versus 9.6%, HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.99, P=0.039) for EES at three years while\n      mortality was similar (Windecker S.

Presentation at\n      the European Society of Cardiology meeting, Stockholm, Sweden, 31st August 2010. 2010).\n      A previous study utilizing a bioresorbable polymer has demonstrated a favorable safety and\n      efficacy profile in a large-scale clinical trial as compared to a first-generation\n      drug-eluting stent. Among 1,707 patients randomized to either a biolimus-eluting stent with\n      a bioresorbable polymer or a sirolimus-eluting stent with a durable polymer no significant\n      differences with regard to the primary endpoint of cardiac death, myocardial infarction or\n      target-vessel revascularization were observed (9.2% versus 10.5%, HR 0.88, 95% CI\n      0.64-1.19;: p=0.39)(Lancet 2008;372:1163-73.)\n      Objective\n      The objective of the study is to compare the safety and efficacy of a sirolimus-eluting\n      stent with a biodegradable polymer with an everolimus-eluting stent with a durable polymer\n      in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial in patients\n      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in routine clinical practice.\n      Methods\n      Design: Prospective, multi-center, randomized, non-inferiority trial.
