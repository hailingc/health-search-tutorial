{"text": "TITLE:\n      Study of High-flow Oxygen Therapy Against Standard Therapy in Bronchiolitis\nSUMMARY:\n      Bronchiolitis is a common illness of the respiratory tract caused by infection of the tiny\n      airways within the lungs called bronchioles. At present the standard care of hospitalized\n      children with bronchiolitis is oxygen via nasal prongs. In this study the investigators\n      would like to compare standard ward management with a new method of delivering oxygen called\n      high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNOT). HFNOT involves breathing warmed, moistened\n      oxygen through nasal cannulae at a flow rate of 8 liters/minute. Accumulated experience\n      suggests that HFNOT eases the child's work of breathing and reduces need for ICU admission\n      and invasive respiratory support.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      We propose a prospective open randomised controlled trial to compare high flow nasal cannula\n      oxygen therapy (HFNOT) with standard oxygen therapy for infants hospitalised with\n      bronchiolitis. This study will be the first of its kind, as currently there is no evidence\n      in the published literature.\n      All children will be cared for by the same medical team on two wards. All aspects of care\n      other than oxygen delivery will not be specified, and be at the discretion of the\n      physicians. HFNOT will not be used as an escalation of care on the wards.\n      Randomisation will be performed by REDcap, in blocks of 6 patients. Patients will be\n      identified in Emergency, informed consent obtained, and treatment started prior to transfer\n      to the ward.\n      For patients randomised to HFNOT, the flow rate will be fixed at 8 liters/minute, and the\n      inspired oxygen concentration titrated to maintain saturations above 92%.\n      Interim statistical analysis will be conducted to determine any positive or negative effect\n      of HFNOT therapy. The first interval analysis will be performed after 50 subjects, the\n      second after 100 subjects. If an effect is found, the study will be terminated following\n      discussion with the hospital statistician and ethics board. Whichever treatment arm is found\n      to be beneficial will be instituted as standard care for children with bronchiolitis.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  All children under 18 months of age with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis\n             requiring admission to hospital for observation and oxygen.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Infants admitted directly to ICU from Emergency.\n          -  Prior positive pressure home ventilation.\n          -  Tracheostomy.\n          -  Nasogastric tubes in situ on admission.\n          -  Upper airway abnormality.\n          -  Congenital heart disease.\n", "cuis": "C0184633 C3665674 C1960973 C0006271 C0006270 C2828392 C3272550 C0087111 C1363945 C1510538 C0947630 C0235146 C1552616 C1706244 C0282335 C1283798 C0458578 C3665591 C0562031 C0006271 C0006270 C0009450 C3714514 C0275524 C0012683 C0035637 C0276041 C0729555 C0747002 C0221423 C0424228 C3245511 C0701159 C0006270 C0178987 C0458827 C2096027 C0024109 C0580931 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0006271 C0445087 C0030054 C0184633 C0947630 C0376636 C0025663 C0025664 C0030054 C0184633 C0870814 C1578513 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0184633 C1546419 C0418996 C1960973 C0179574 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0179574 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0030054 C0184633 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0184666 C0809949 C0042497 C0087153 C2266627 C1546767 C1334278 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0179574 C0282440 C0184633 C1546419 C0418996 C1960973 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0006271 C0947630 C0023866 C1704324 C0580931 C0040399 C0015726 C0429622 C4048188 C0580931 C0028778 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0514044 C0802641 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0728827 C0040671 C1550043 C0600091 C2594846 C0428648 C0428647 C0428649 C0746961 C0678723 C1254042 C0201956 C0376259 C0721534 C0002778 C1514241 C1513916 C0087111 C0033972 C0520883 C0002778 C1553407 C0947630 C0557061 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0972401 C0446516 C1140618 C0006271 C0580931 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0006271 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C1561542 C3272565 C0184666 C3650404 C2215406 C2215408 C0583225 C0478530 C0700325 C0557985 C1964257 C0030054 C0184633 C0243161 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0184666 C0809949 C0035203 C2945579 C0460139 C1514241 C0040590 C3282907 C0184666 C0809949 C0175730 C0178987 C0458827 C2096027 C1704258 C3809765 C0152021 C0455683 ", "concepts": "Oxygen Therapy Care, Oxygen Therapy, Home Oxygen Therapy, Bronchiolitis, Bronchioli, Standard, Standard, Therapy, Therapy, E-Therapy, Study, High summary, summary respiratory tracts, Respiratory tract, Upper respiratory tract, Lower respiratory tract, burn;
