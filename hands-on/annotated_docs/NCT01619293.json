{"text": "TITLE:\n      The Neuromarker S-100B in Patients With Different Types of Intracranial Injury\nSUMMARY:\n      Abstract:\n      The most widely studied neuro-markers in traumatic brain injury (TBI) are S100B and neurone\n      specific enolase (NSE). S-100B is localized in astroglia. This marker is used to predict\n      neuronal damage caused by traumatic brain injury. The investigators conduct a study to\n      derive and validate the measurement of S-100B in serum of patients with different types\n      traumatic brain injuries.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The neuromarker S-100B is a well established tool for decision making in patients traumatic\n      brain injury (TBI)in Europe. In many hospitals S-100B is used routinely as a part of a set\n      of high- and medium risk factors aiding the decision to perform a cranial computed\n      tomography (CCT) in patients with minor head injury (MHI). In patients with severe head\n      injury Raabe et al. found a significant correlation between the S-100B levels and\n      unfavourable outcome in patients with severe brain injury with serum levels higher than 0.50\n      \u03bcg/l measured 24h after injury. The average level of the neuromarker, compared with other\n      studies. The study of Biberthaler et al. showed highest levels in patients with epidural\n      hematomas, followed by subdural, subarachnoidal and intracerebral hematomas. On the contrary\n      the average S-100B levels of patients with epidural hematomas featured in a study by Unden\n      et al. published in 2005 displayed normal levels (<0.2 \u03bcg/L). They concluded that S-100B was\n      unreliable as a marker for epidural hematomas.\n      Aim of the study Validation of S-100B in patients with intracerebral, epidural, subdural,\n      and subarachnoidal hematoma, brain edema and concussion (Group 1-6), to find evidence which\n      kind of injury leads to which level of elevation of the neuromarker measured in peripheral\n      blood.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  all patients with traumatic brain injury\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  patients without traumatic brain injury\n", "cuis": "C0524466 C0032268 C0430797 C3263722 C3263723 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0600678 C0876926 C0006107 C2832052 C0272927 C2832047 C0005516 C0950952 C1552740 C0005516 C0876926 C0006107 C2832052 C0272927 C2832047 C0010957 C0947630 C0229671 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C0876926 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0011109 C0270611 C0036849 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0679006 C0423908 C0037303 C1441526 C0555305 C0040395 C0040405 C0034579 C0018670 C0152336 C1306232 C3263723 C0270611 C0229671 C1306232 C3263723 C0812144 C1283259 C1550254 C0947630 C0018944 C0238154 C0877172 C0947630 C1553386 C1704324 C0238154 C0877172 C0005516 C3858758 C0812144 C1283259 C1550254 C0947630 C2948600 C1527311 C0006114 C0006107 C0018944 C1962958 C0441861 C4050003 C0441862 C0441863 C0441864 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C3263723 C0181586 C0005768 C0229664 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0876926 C0006107 C2832052 C0272927 C2832047 C0243161 C0876926 C0006107 C2832052 C0272927 C2832047 ", "concepts": "Intracranial, Intracranial Gas, Intracranial EEG, Injury, Injury, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary Abstract TBI (traumatic brain injury), Mild traumatic brain injury, focal traumatic brain injury, Closed traumatic brain injury, diffuse traumatic brain injury, marker, Aponeuron specific, marker TBI (traumatic brain injury), Mild traumatic brain injury, focal traumatic brain injury, Closed traumatic brain injury, diffuse traumatic brain injury, damage, study serum, ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement traumatic brain injuries description, prescription, prescription decision making brain injury, set risk factors, risk factors, No risk factors, A/N risk factors, decision, Indecision, cranial, Computed minor head injury, Tomography, tomography, Pantomography, head, head, severed injury brain injury, serum, severed injury epidurals, Epidural, Epidural, study hematomas epidural hematoma, Epidural hematoma, study normal, Published epidural hematoma, Epidural hematoma, marker, reliable epidurals, Epidural, Epidural, study, Aim Brain edema, Brain edema, concussion, hematomas, Hematoma, Group 1, Group 1, Group 1A, Group 1B, Group 1C elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation, injury, leads blood, blood criteria, Eligibility Criteria TBI (traumatic brain injury), Mild traumatic brain injury, focal traumatic brain injury, Closed traumatic brain injury, diffuse traumatic brain injury Criteria TBI (traumatic brain injury), Mild traumatic brain injury, focal traumatic brain injury, Closed traumatic brain injury, diffuse traumatic brain injury "}
