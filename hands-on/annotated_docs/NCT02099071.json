{"text": "TITLE:\n      Study to Investigate the Tolerability, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of ACT-389949\nSUMMARY:\n      This is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,\n      ascending single oral dose and food interaction Phase 1 study. It will evaluate the safety,\n      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ascending single oral doses of\n      ACT-389949 in healthy male subjects. It will also investigate the effect of food on the\n      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of ACT-389949.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -
