{"text": "TITLE:\n      Comparison of Valsartan With Amlodipine in Hypertensive Patients With Glucose Intolerance\nSUMMARY:\n      Various guidelines recommended angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin\n      \u2161 receptor-1 blockers (ARBs) for hypertensive patients with diabetes on the basis of the\n      cardiac- and reno-protective effects of these drugs. However, these recommendations could\n      not be extrapolated to Japanese patients, because Japan has been known as a country with a\n      low incidence of coronary artery disease and a high incidence of cerebrovascular disease.\n      Furthermore, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) also were protective against renal function as\n      well as ACE inhibitors in Japanese diabetic hypertensive patients. This study will test\n      whether ARBs or CCBs are superior in treating Japanese diabetic hypertensive patients.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Clinical diagnosis of hypertension\n          -  Clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  History of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or coronary\n             revascularization in the recent 6 months.\n          -  Taking calcium channel blocker for the purpose of angina pectoris\n          -  Reduced ejection fraction (< 40%)\n          -  Second- or third-degree of atrioventricular block\n          -  Severe hypertension (> 200/110 mmHg) or secondary hypertension\n          -  History of stroke in the recent 6 months\n          -  Serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dl\n          -  Estimated survival duration less than 3 years due to other conditions\n          -  Pregnant woman or possibly pregnant woman\n", "cuis": "C0271650 C0857121 C0947663 C0051696 C0216784 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0003018 C0003009 C0162791 C0220845 C0282423 C0440102 C0857121 C0947663 C0003364 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0013227 C0018787 C1550710 C3845898 C0010054 C1956346 C0010068 C0007820 C0585890 C0393949 C0810006 C0553766 C0393950 C1550472 C0006684 C0872271 C0005116 C0022662 C0003015 C0857121 C0947663 C0003364 C0241863 C0947630 C0392366 C0456984 C0857121 C0947663 C0003364 C0241863 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C3272565 C0271650 C0159069 C2830475 C0011860 C1320657 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C3272565 C0243161 C0018802 C0264719 C0264722 C0742758 C2039715 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727 C2348362 C1168331 C0455406 C0340324 C1998297 C0340312 C0340325 C0428950 C2825159 C0018787 C0262926 C2004062 C0581603 C0581712 C0027686 C0472662 C0007794 C0027056 C1561542 C0006684 C0872271 C0358701 C0573229 C0002962 C0455530 C4022792 C4022793 C0004245 C2215934 C2882257 C1621824 C0542560 C0155616 C0348586 C0155620 C0581373 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C1547227 C1547231 C1561581 C4050465 C4050466 C0264097 C0262926 C2004062 C0038454 C1561542 C0201976 C0600061 C0858112 C0428282 C0012634 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C3843322 C1441829 C0549206 ", "concepts": "Glucose Intolerance, Hypertensive, Hypertensin, Amlodipine, Valsartan, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary angiotensin, 2 angiotensin, Guidelines, guidelines, guideline, Various hypertensive, hypertensin, Antihypertensive, Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes drugs, cardiac country, Uknown coronary artery diseases, CAD (coronary artery disease), coronary diseases, CVD -
