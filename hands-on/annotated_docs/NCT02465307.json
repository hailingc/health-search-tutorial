{"text": "TITLE:\n      Motion Analysis of Delirium in the ICU\nSUMMARY:\n      Delirium, as a common complication of hospitalization, poses significant health problems in\n      hospitalized patients. Though about a third of delirium cases can benefit from intervention,\n      detecting and predicting delirium is still very limited in practice. A common\n      characterization of delirium is changes in activity level, causing patients to become\n      hyperactive or hypoactive which is manifested in facial expressions and total body\n      movements. This pilot study is designed to test the feasibility of a delirium detection\n      system using movement data obtained from 3-axis wearable accelerometers and Microsoft Kinect\n      sensor, in conjunction with electronics medical record (EMR) data to analyze the relation of\n      whole-body movement as well as facial expressions with delirium.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The aim of the study is to assess the potential of motion and facial expression data for\n      detecting delirium in ICU patients by comparing motion and facial expression patterns in\n      delirium and control group. In this study, the investigators will use ActivePalTM\n      accelerometer to record each subject's movement patterns. Also, a processed video using the\n      KINECT application-programming interface to identify patient facial expressions and movement\n      patterns. A total of 40 participants will be enrolled with delirium and 20 patients without\n      delirium will be used as control group. Motion profiles will be compared in the motorically\n      defined subgroups (hyperactive, hypoactive, normal) based on accelerometer and Kinect data.\n      Then differences in facial expression, number of changes in postures and percentage of time\n      spent moving between motorically defined subgroups and in delirium and control group. EMR\n      data will also be used to assess the feasibility of detecting delirium by additionally\n      including information on related risk factors.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Intensive care unit patient\n          -  18 years of age or older\n          -  Eligibility confirmed within 24 hours of admission\n          -  Positive Confusion Assessment Method score\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Anticipated intensive care unit stay less than one day\n          -  Less than 18 years of age\n          -  Inability to wear a motion sensor watch (ActivPal)\n", "cuis": "C0002778 C0011206 C1552616 C1706244 C0019993 C3840878 C3841837 C3841838 C0009566 C1171258 C1148100 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C0161815 C0185026 C0011206 C3245511 C0033213 C2081614 C0701159 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0011206 C0011206 C0237607 C3245512 C3245511 C3845947 C0683317 C1321018 C0011206 C0015457 C0813217 C0424295 C0152338 C0086439 C0011206 C0947630 C0392366 C0456984 C0026649 C1511790 C0178951 C3245479 C0026649 C0025102 C0551625 C1554096 C0746463 C3245479 C0233492 C0179038 C0015457 C0813217 C0026649 C0011206 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0015457 C0813217 C1855353 C0947630 C3245479 C0013987 C2222792 C0015457 C0813217 C1855353 C0011206 C0013987 C0011206 C0947630 C1552839 C0596948 C0427096 C0423081 C0178951 C0034869 C0015457 C0813217 C0185125 C0376495 C1947919 C2347934 C0185026 C2698172 C3858576 C0026649 C0011206 C0011206 C1552839 C0178951 C0424295 C1553386 C3245479 C0086439 C0015457 C0813217 C1855353 C1720594 C0085632 C0011206 C0560560 C1552839 C0596948 C0011206 C3245479 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C3242430 C1561528 C0233492 C0445356 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0085559 C1555709 C1948032 C0013893 C0184666 C0809949 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1261322 C2826217 C0009676 C0683369 C1963086 C2712099 C1514241 C0025663 C2827714 C2828387 C0243161 C0085559 C3840775 C1561538 C0013987 ", "concepts": "Analysis, Delirium summary, summary hospitalization, Hospitalization 1, Hospitalization 3, Hospitalization 2, Complications, complications, NB complication, Complications, IUD complication, IUD complication, CNS complication, plication, Delirium, common, problem, problem: hospitalized, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, delirium delirium, practices, practice, common, Very limited activity level, Hyperactivity level, delirium facial expressions, Dull facial expression, hyperactive, body, Hypoactive delirium, study, test, test, Movements, Detection accelerometers, data, Movement medical recording, Medical records, Medical records, medical record lost, data, elation, analyzer facial expressions, Dull facial expression, body movement, delirium description, prescription, prescription facial expression, Dull facial expression, Fixed facial expression, study, data, Emotion, OT potential facial expression, Dull facial expression, Fixed facial expression, delirium, Emotion delirium, study, groups, mind control movement patterns, Eye movement pattern, accelerometer, record facial expressions, Dull facial expression, applications, Reapplication, Application, Application, plication, Interface, deidentify, Movement delirium delirium, groups accelerometer, hyperactive, normal, data, Hypoactive facial expression, Dull facial expression, Fixed facial expression, Then, Indifference delirium, moving, groups, mind control delirium, data risk factors, risk factors, No risk factors, A/N risk factors, informational, Information, elated, Unrelated criteria, Eligibility Criteria Intensive care folder, Folder Eligibility, admissions, Admission assessment, Assessment, Assessment, assessment, No Assessment, confusion, Confusion, Confusion, No Confusion, Positive, Methods, Method, Method Criteria intensive care, Anticipated, day Emotion "}
