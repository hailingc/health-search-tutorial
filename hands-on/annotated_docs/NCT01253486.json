{"text": "TITLE:\n      Expressive Writing for Heart Healing\nSUMMARY:\n      This study will determine whether the psychological and physical benefits of expressive\n      writing extend to obese in-patients with Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD)referred to cardiac\n      rehabilitation\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Expressive writing, for as little as 3-5 sessions of 20 minutes, has been found to improve\n      both physical and psychological health based on health outcome measures such as number of\n      doctor's visits and hospital days, blood pressure control, lung and immune function, pain,\n      anxiety and depression. Given its simplicity and obvious advantages in terms of\n      cost-effectiveness, expressive writing has great potential as a therapeutic tool or as a\n      means of self-help, either alone or as an adjunct to traditional therapies. This modality\n      has not been studied in obese patients with Ischemic Heart Disease.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  obesity\n          -  Ischemic Heart disease\n          -  Signed informed consent\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Visual or manual limitations that preclude reading and writing\n          -  Unwilling to participate\n", "cuis": "C2584304 C4050126 C0043240 C0018787 C0153500 C0153957 C1281570 C1552616 C1706244 C1306597 C0848372 C0947630 C0311392 C0151744 C0018787 C0028754 C1170317 C0007237 C0034991 C0018459 C4042802 C0204096 C0204601 C0728952 C0419104 C0458264 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0233697 C0886384 C0025353 C0031809 C1509143 C3272557 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0020649 C0725357 C2230142 C0020538 C2926615 C0180208 C0428889 C0428886 C0488053 C0497247 C0031843 C1705273 C0024109 C0030193 C1512346 C0011570 C0011581 C0344315 C0812393 C1579931 C1999266 C4049644 C0035143 C0429068 C0429108 C0520887 C0003467 C0860603 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C2222792 C0087111 C0005527 C2717877 C1551994 C1552861 C1547664 C0151744 C0028754 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0028754 C0018799 C0022116 C1519316 C0009797 C0243161 C0024763 C0558080 C0600109 ", "concepts": "Writing, Writing, Healing, Hearts, Heart, Heart, Heart summary, summary psychological, psychological tic, study, find physical Ischemic Heart Disease, cardiac, obese, Hextend rehabilitation, care rehabilitation, habilitation, Telerehabilitations, Neurorehabilitation, drug rehabilitation, drug rehabilitation, Oral rehabilitation, Pain rehabilitation description, prescription, prescription Obsessions, 5 minutes psychological health, Physical, Physical, Physical Blood pressure, take blood pressure, blood pressures, low blood pressures, blood pressure kit, blood pressure leg, high blood pressure, High blood pressure, blood pressure cuff, Cuff blood pressure, mean blood pressure, Mean blood pressure, blood pressure rise, function, Function, lung, pain, visit Depressions, Depression, depression, depression, depression, Depression, Depression, Repression, PR depression, TU depression, depression st, anxiety, anxiety Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic, OT potential therapies, Biotherapies, Apitherapies, self, help, Modality Ischemic Heart Disease, obese criteria, Eligibility Criteria obesity Heart disease, Ischemia Signed, informed consent form Criteria manual Unwilling, willing "}
