{"text": "TITLE:\n      Echo-Cardiographic Assessment of Cardiovascular Characteristics During Pregnancy and Postpartum Periods\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this echocardiographic study is to restudy the longitudinal changes in\n      cardiac size and function during and after pregnancy in healthy women using relatively new\n      parameters of systolic and diastolic function as well as classical measures of left\n      ventricle (LV) function using contemporary echocardiographic machines.\n      We, the researchers at Hillel Yaffe Medical Center, will assess diastolic function and its\n      possible relation to shortness of breath.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      A comprehensive echocardiographic study of the heart will be conducted in the first, second\n      and third trimesters of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum.\n      Determination of left ventricular dimensions, transvalvular Doppler flow, ejection fraction,\n      stroke volume, cardiac output, pulmonary vein flow, tissue Doppler, flow propagation, global\n      and segmental strain parameters, timing of peak strain and various parameters of diastolic\n      function will be obtained.\n      From these data normal values for various stages of pregnancy will be determined as well as\n      range for changes expected during longitudinal follow-up will be determined.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Healthy women\n          -  First trimester of a normal pregnancy\n          -  Normal baseline echocardiogram\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Pregnancy with more than one fetus.\n          -  Any hemodynamically significant cardiac condition\n          -  Any known systemic disease\n          -  Poor quality echocardiogram\n", "cuis": "C3887460 C0007220 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1261322 C2826217 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0025344 C0179620 C0221533 C0022396 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C0183129 C0013516 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0031843 C1705273 C0018787 C1578513 C0031843 C1705273 C0018790 C1995642 C0442709 C0449381 C0018827 C2355627 C0031843 C1705273 C0183129 C0013516 C3245481 C0031843 C1705273 C0199168 C1561579 C3810851 C0012000 C0428883 C0013404 C2707305 C4054349 C0748649 C0233492 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0947630 C0018787 C0183129 C0013516 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C1561542 C0489482 C2020641 C2700378 C0743400 C1545667 C0180980 C0056085 C0018827 C0554756 C1148554 C0007165 C2007409 C2040725 C0007166 C0034090 C1456806 C0226670 C1281661 C0817375 C0038455 C2040724 C0554756 C0080194 C1510453 C0449381 C0012000 C0428883 C0031843 C1705273 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C1553386 C3245479 C1300072 C4055646 C1517001 C2702329 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0232989 C0278056 C0700573 C0013516 C2243117 C0183129 C2022421 C2022422 C2040661 C2022577 C2022578 C0231683 C1550457 C1551394 C1873497 C0728774 C0243161 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0018787 C0442893 C3845898 C0013516 C2243117 C0183129 C2022421 C2022422 C2040661 C2022577 C2022578 C1547310 ", "concepts": "Cardiovascular, Cardiovascular drug, assessment, Assessment, Assessment, assessment, No Assessment, pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
