{"text": "TITLE:\n      Lateral Cord Stimulation as a New Treatment for Refractory Spastic Cerebral Palsy\nSUMMARY:\n      The aim of our work is to investigate whether electrical Lateral Cord Stimulation (LCS)\n      causes an inhibitory and modulatory action by indirect cerebellar activation, so releasing\n      spasticity and the spastic syndrome in selected cases of patients with cerebral palsy\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      PROJECT Lateral Cord Stimulation was thought by the author to be employed in patients with\n      spastic cerebral palsy with the aim to improve tonus, motor function and speech.\n      Nevertheless, as it has been demonstrated as acting on the basic phenomena related with\n      spasticity, it's to say the propagated spinal responses, its use could be extended to other\n      forms of spastic disease, like spastic limbs post stroke, brain congenital malformations\n      producing spasticity and motor disorders as the main signs, post anoxic encephalopathy, etc.\n      In this preliminary clinical trial, classed as phase 3, our sample must be very limited to\n      assure stable conditions for statistical significance, hence our group is going to be\n      circumscribed to certain conditions and pathology.\n      In the future, as long the method could spread its use, the extension on indications in\n      other pathological conditions is advisable thus, its possibilities of marketing could be\n      enlarged with its use in a broader spectrum of spastic patients.\n      Calculated risks are similar to those related with the ancient surgical technique called\n      \"Scoville\"technique, currently employed time ago for cervical discectomy (6) Investigational\n      plan The purpose of this clinical trial is to release spasticity and by this means improve\n      the condition of patients with spastic cerebral palsy by extradural lateral cord electrical\n      stimulation, by using currently employed electrodes and neurostimulators Those devices are\n      already FDA approved and currently used for Dorsal Column Stimulation with the objective to\n      treat chronic Pain and spasticity (Spasmodic Torticollis).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Aged sixteen or older\n          -  Spastic Cerebral Palsy with stable condition\n          -  Motor disability unilateral or predominantly unilateral.\n          -  Troubles of speech clinically evident.\n          -  Normal or Slightly sub-normal I.Q\n          -  No psychiatric disorders.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Severe cardiac or respiratory troubles\n          -  Fixed abnormal postures (except if previously corrected by orthopedic surgery)\n          -  Chronic recurrent bronchial or pulmonary infections\n          -  Chronic recurrent urinary infections\n          -  Severe osteoporosis on affected limbs\n          -  Chronic skin ulcerations.\n", "cuis": "C0338596 C1292856 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C1550235 C1552616 C1706244 C1292856 C1550235 C1552007 C0007765 C0270814 C0007789 C0026838 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C1292856 C0557351 C0041674 C1550235 C0338596 C3840147 C0837179 C0031843 C1705273 C0037817 C0846595 C2137063 C0233492 C0445356 C0877217 C1137023 C0026838 C1704632 C0606665 C0443306 C0012634 C0018609 C0038454 C0015385 C0561942 C0006104 C0003857 C0015393 C0003132 C0752304 C0149504 C1140716 C0520705 C0520706 C0221163 C0026838 C1096775 C3845947 C0441621 C1716046 C0012634 C1552839 C0677042 C0919386 C0012634 C0087130 C0025663 C0025664 C1525442 C3854112 C0233494 C0012634 C0443306 C1293134 C1443182 C1441792 C0025664 C0233492 C0445356 C0543467 C0587668 C0408598 C0557351 C0041674 C3245491 C0220825 C1261322 C0013230 C1552578 C1096775 C0026838 C1963578 C0338596 C3840147 C0837179 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0582124 C1292856 C1515885 C0013812 C0557351 C0041674 C1292856 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C1185738 C0152116 C0026838 C0030193 C1882272 C2598155 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1555709 C1948032 C0338596 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0231170 C0037817 C0846595 C2137063 C0722792 C0231683 C1550457 C1551394 C1873497 C1553386 C0004936 C0233514 C0525045 C2015805 C0455498 C0851576 C2013984 C0243161 C0018787 C1547227 C1547231 C1561581 C4050465 C4050466 C0264097 C0042497 C0087153 C2266627 C1546767 C1136201 C2827483 C0231471 C0876973 C0205039 C0719022 C1442216 C1546565 C1550618 C0006255 C1547296 C1555457 C3714514 C0009450 C0275524 C2707258 C0729555 C0747002 C1547296 C1555457 C1859443 C0015385 C0561942 C0037299 C1547296 C1555457 ", "concepts": "Spastic Cerebral Palsy, Stimulation, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Cord summary, summary Stimulation, Cord action, Cerebellar spastic syndrome, cerebral palsy, spasticity description, prescription, prescription Stimulation, employed, Unemployed, Cord Spastic cerebral palsy NOS, Non-spastic cerebral palsy, Other spastic cerebral palsy, function, Function, speech, speech, speech elated, Unrelated, Abasic, basica spasticity, response, pinal spastic, disease, h disease, stroke, limbs, Climbs, brain, av malformations, eye malformations Anoxic encephalopathy, NOS, Anoxic encephalopathy, Toxic encephalopathy, hypoxic encephalopathy, Acute anoxic encephalopathy, Chronic anoxic encephalopathy, motor disorders, spasticity clinical trial, Very limited, sampled, Dx preliminary condition, groups pathology, pathology, condition, Uncertain method, methods, W extension, Extension, tension condition spastic, Enlarged Calculated, US+Calculated, techniques, elated, Unrelated, Surgical, Surgical cervical discectomy, employed, Unemployed, investigational, Investigation, Investigations, Investigational Drug, investigation clinical trial, spasticity, release Spastic cerebral palsy NOS, Non-spastic cerebral palsy, Other spastic cerebral palsy, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition neurostimulators, stimulation, Acustimulation, electrodes, employed, Unemployed Stimulation, Objective, objective, Objective, Column Spasmodic Torticollis, spasticity, Pain, Pain, Pain criteria, Eligibility Criteria folder, Folder Spastic Cerebral Palsy, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition disability speech, speech, speech, Prevident Normal, Normal, Normal, Normal, normal psychiatric; disorder, Psychiatric disorders, psychiatric disorders mood, other psychiatric disorders, H/O: psychiatric disorder, Psychiatric disorders NEC, organic psychiatric disorders Criteria cardiac, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Sever, respirators, respirator, respirator, Respiratory orthopedic surgery, Fixed, abnormal posture pulmonary infections, bronchial, Bronchial, Bronchial, Bronchial, Bronchial, bronchi, Chronic, Chronic Infections, infection, Coinfections, Infections, gi infections, infections op, Chronic, Chronic Severe osteoporosis, limbs, Climbs skin ulcerations, Chronic, Chronic "}
