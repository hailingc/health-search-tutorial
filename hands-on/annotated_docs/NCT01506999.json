{"text": "TITLE:\n      Genetic Mapping for Cardiac Risk Assessment\nSUMMARY:\n      The main objective of the GENOCOR project (Genetic mapping for cardiac risk assessment) is\n      the setting up of a joint public/private laboratory (GENOCOR-LAB) dedicated to the\n      development and testing of new cost-effective technologies exploiting the growing knowledge\n      in the genomic correlates of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and of their evolution; the data\n      obtained by the GENOCOR-Lab should especially orient secondary prevention and specific\n      treatment of ischemic heart diseases (IHD).\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The Laboratory will be based in the premises of the CNR Institute of Clinical Physiology, a\n      research institution operating as CVD Research Hospital System, with two Hospital Units (CNR\n      Campus in Pisa and G. Pasquinucci Hospital in Massa).\n      The project is based on the cooperation of a national private company (DiaSorin, endowed\n      with promising proprietary technologies in the novel diagnostic biotechnologies) and three\n      research units (at clinical and molecular biology level) two from the National Research\n      Council (IFC-CNR, Pisa and ITB-CNR, Milano, both very active in advanced biological\n      research) and one from the University Vita-Salute San Raffaele (UHSR, Milano, operating a\n      top range hospital and center for advanced biological research): GENOCOR Lab becomes then\n      the first product of the cooperation within the CNR MERIT Network (MEdical Reseach in ITaly)\n      currently being set-up by CNR.\n      The project is based on the availability of proprietary large scale databases of selected\n      clinical populations that will be probed with the novel genomic and post-genomic\n      technologies. High throughput SNPs technologies and post-genomic expression and proteomic\n      analyses will be used to assess profiles of genetic variability identifying subjects with a\n      distinct proneness to ischemic heart disease (IHD), hard cardiovascular events and\n      unfavourable outcomes. Specific focusing will be made possible by the availability, within\n      the proposed research network, of well established clinical data bases and biological sample\n      collections, enabling the retrospective and prospective access to large and well\n      characterised populations of patients with IHD. Cardiovascular phenotypes will include\n      patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction) and\n      patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and prolonged follow-up; with this approach, it\n      will be possible to cover both short-term and long-term evolution by detailed clinical,\n      biohumoral and instrumental phenotyping at the time of acute events and with a systematic\n      follow-up.\n      This approach should allow to overcome the major limitations and unbalance of previous\n      studies, either focussed to small well characterized populations in which few genetic\n      variations have been explored, or extended to large populations with a wider gene\n      variability approach but inadequate information on phenotype and evolution disease.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients affected by history of IHD with a non-fatal evolution(angina or AMI as first\n             manifestation),age at the onset of the disease (<50 o >60 years.\n          -  Patients with acute coronary syndrome as first manifestation of coronary disease,\n             admitted to the coronary unit within 6 hours from the onset of symptoms.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Age>75\n          -  Pregnancy\n          -  Recent(< 6 months) cerebral ischemic attack\n          -  Active cancer\n          -  Inability to provide an informed consent.\n", "cuis": "C0008630 C0086930 C3539808 C0018787 C0007144 C0153417 C1262603 C1552616 C1706244 C0086930 C2224544 C0557998 C1532976 C3539560 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0018787 C0008630 C1552597 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C3812868 C3812869 C0204854 C3887804 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0376554 C4036285 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C1578513 C0683887 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0042373 C0558373 C3245479 C2948499 C0679699 C1552740 C0018799 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0151744 C0022116 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C3272565 C0031843 C1546848 C0543467 C3244306 C3854058 C4049936 C0679622 C3272561 C0011900 C0358514 C0430022 C1547424 C0683887 C3272565 C1320102 C1548762 C3272559 C1548762 C3272559 C2702329 C0543467 C3244306 C0036849 C0242356 C0993637 C0175659 C0349674 C0237849 C0684254 C3272561 C0679622 C0182400 C0728863 C3272565 C0185117 C0235146 C0683887 C1948182 C0179038 C0391369 C0151744 C1313980 C0010054 C1510446 C0264694 C1320716 C2605207 C0000936 C2981153 C1552740 C3245479 C0441621 C1548762 C3272559 C3272565 C1171285 C0600644 C0034770 C3887460 C0007220 C0151744 C1285572 C0427628 C0427641 C0427649 C0599990 C1292167 C0155626 C0340294 C0582803 C0264708 C0027051 C2063313 C1735640 C0340311 C0155668 C0428953 C0948089 C0002965 C0340288 C0264694 C0155669 C2063003 C0151744 C1313980 C0151872 C0151878 C0180153 C2948499 C3272565 C0348000 C1285572 C1285573 C1737826 C0014653 C2174421 C1254223 C0947630 C1948182 C0180799 C1285572 C0427649 C0599990 C1292167 C0391848 C0427628 C0427641 C0427642 C0427644 C0427645 C0427646 C0427647 C1292165 C1292166 C1292197 C1292208 C1292244 C1319023 C0012634 C0018609 C2948499 C3242430 C1561528 C0391369 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0262926 C2004062 C0151744 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0012634 C0018609 C3843766 C0948089 C0010068 C1956346 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0015411 C0184666 C0809949 C0018787 C1457887 C0243161 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0745413 C0006104 C0228174 C1561542 C0718247 C0006826 C0260515 C1555587 C0009797 ", "concepts": "Genetic Mapping, Risk Assessments, Risk Assessment, Cardiac, Cardia, Cardia, Cardiacap summary, summary risk assessment, FAP risk assessment, Fire risk assessment, Fall risk assessment, Fall risk assessment, Objective, objective, Objective, cardiac, genetic mapping public, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory, Medicated, Medicated, Tap of joint, upsetting development, Development, Development, Development, No development, knowledge, No knowledge, testing, q testing, t testing, new, new technologies CVD -
