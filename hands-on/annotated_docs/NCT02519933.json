{"text": "TITLE:\n      A Comparison of mNT-BBAVF and BCAVF in Hemodialysis Patients\nSUMMARY:\n      A well-functioning vascular access is essential for effective hemodialysis. The native\n      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access because of the lower thrombosis\n      and infection risks compared to either synthetic arteriovenous grafts or central venous\n      catheters. Brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (BCAVF) and transposed brachiobasilic\n      arteriovenous fistula (T-BBAVF) are recommended when there is either a primary failure or no\n      suitable vessels for the forearm fistula. However, BCAVF is frequently cannulated at the\n      antecubital fossa, the risks of stenosis and thrombosis are high, which will compromise\n      proper BCAVF function and survival. T-BBAVF is not only technically challenging, but also\n      associates with severe arm swelling and pain. Thus, the investigators introduced a novel\n      modified Non-transposed brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula (mNT-BBAVF) for long-term\n      hemodialysis patients. To confirm its efficacy, a prospective clinical study would be\n      carried out.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The study aims to compare the outcomes of a novel modified Non-transposed brachiobasilic\n      arteriovenous fistula (mNT-BBAVF) and the standard brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula\n      (BCAVF) for long-term hemodialysis patients. Briefly, in mNT-BBAVF, a side-to-side\n      anastomosis between the brachial artery and non-transposed proximal basilic vein is\n      disposed, followed by the ligation of the vein above anastomosis. All the perforating in the\n      surgical field should be ligated. All patients will be followed up for 12 months after\n      surgeries. The outcomes includes: hemodynamic parameters (vessels's diameters, blood flow\n      velocities and blood volumes) detected by ultrasound in 12 months, Complications in 1-month\n      and 12-month, primary patency and secondary patency (cumulative patency).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Age from 18 to 75 years;\n          -  Radial artery diameter <2.0 mm or cephalic vein diameter in the forearm <2.5 mm;\n          -  Brachial artery diameter \u2265 2 mm\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Stenosis or thrombosis present in the draining vein;\n          -  A history of peripheral ischemia in upper extremities;\n          -  Active local or systemic infections;\n          -  Inability to consent for the procedure;\n          -  Patients with previous dysfunctional forearm fistula.\n", "cuis": "C0019004 C0577541 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0750138 C0042371 C0280956 C0019004 C0750138 C0042371 C0280956 C0040053 C2586211 C0302148 C2963140 C0752156 C3878495 C2230323 C0582147 C2937317 C3810841 C0085590 C1704454 C0179768 C0745442 C1322976 C2963140 C0752156 C3878495 C2230323 C0006095 C1278962 C0229763 C2963140 C0752156 C3878495 C2230323 C0005847 C0016536 C0446523 C0694648 C0694665 C0040053 C2586211 C0302148 C2945640 C1261287 C0031843 C1705273 C0577598 C2038705 C0679622 C0030193 C1306232 C0456642 C2584846 C0019004 C0947630 C3272565 C0699809 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0947630 C0679622 C2963140 C0752156 C3878495 C2230323 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0006095 C0019004 C0006087 C1278940 C0226425 C1267367 C0489796 C0226801 C1278972 C0677554 C0191146 C0677554 C0549099 C1553496 C1561542 C0543467 C0587668 C0232338 C0455822 C0455848 C0543467 C0005847 C0449381 C0009566 C0802632 C1171258 C2708284 C4032686 C0041618 C2368378 C0412555 C3525387 C0442726 C1511790 C0005768 C0229664 C1561542 C0027627 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1114365 C0162857 C1278948 C0226802 C1278970 C0016536 C0006087 C1278940 C0489796 C3842089 C0243161 C0040053 C2586211 C0302148 C1261287 C0042449 C1554161 C0235490 C1140618 C0230332 C0522035 C0262926 C2004062 C3714514 C0009450 C0275524 C2707258 C0729555 C0747002 C0718247 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0016536 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 ", "concepts": "Hemodialysis, Hemodialysis NEC, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary vascular access, vascular access port, poor vascular access, hemodialysis vascular access, vascular access port, poor vascular access, Thrombosis, thrombosis, Thrombosis, Arteriovenous fistula, dural arteriovenous fistula, Arteriovenous fistula kit, arteriovenous fistula on exam infection risks, Arteriovenous graft, Biosynthetic catheter, catheter, catheters iv, catheters iv, catheters cv, Arteriovenous fistula, dural arteriovenous fistula, Arteriovenous fistula kit, arteriovenous fistula on exam, Brachiocephalic Vein, Brachiocephalic vein, Brachiocephalic node Arteriovenous fistula, dural arteriovenous fistula, Arteriovenous fistula kit, arteriovenous fistula on exam vessels, forearm antecubital fossa, left antecubital fossa, right antecubital fossa, Thrombosis, thrombosis, Thrombosis, compromise, stenosis function, Function arm swelling, forearm swelling, novel, pain, severed, introducer Transposed brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula hemodialysis, study, Clinical carried description, prescription, prescription study, novel Arteriovenous fistula, dural arteriovenous fistula, Arteriovenous fistula kit, arteriovenous fistula on exam, standards, Standard, Standard, brachiocephalic vein hemodialysis brachial arteries, Brachial artery, Deep brachial artery, Deep brachial artery, Left brachial artery, basilic veins, Basilic vein, anastomosis ligation of vein, anastomosis, perforating field, month, Surgical, Surgical blood flow, LV blood flow, RV blood flow, surgeries, vessels, Parameters complications, Complications, complications, Complications Doc, No Complication, ultrasounds, ultrasound, ob ultrasound, 3D ultrasound, detected, Detected, blood, blood, month secondary criteria, Eligibility Criteria Age radial artery, Radial artery, cephalic veins, Cephalic vein, forearm brachial artery, Brachial artery, Brachial artery.left, 2 mm Criteria Thrombosis, thrombosis, Thrombosis, Stenosis, vein, Training peripheral ischemia, upper extremities, Both upper extremities, Edema upper extremities, history, history Infections, infection, Coinfections, Infections, gi infections, infections op, Active Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure forearm, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient "}
