{"text": "TITLE:\n      Imaging of Traumatic Brain Injury\nSUMMARY:\n      This project aims to study the prognostic ability of various MRI imaging markers in the\n      evaluation of TBI patients. Cognitive, social, and occupational recovery will be measured at\n      each time point, and compared to MRI findings. Healthy volunteers will serve as a comparison\n      to the TBI patients.\n      It is hypothesized that novel MRI markers of metabolism, hemodynamics, functional\n      connectivity, and tissue microstructure will be related to the clinical status of the\n      patient, as well as their social and occupational outcomes.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The goal of this study is to identify advanced magnetic resonance imaging markers that can\n      serve as a prognostic marker in the evaluation and management of traumatic brain injury\n      patients.\n      Magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive testing (when possible) will be performed in the\n      acute (within 10 days following injury), and recovery stages (about 1 month, about 6\n      months,and about 18 months). The relationship between the advanced magnetic resonance\n      imaging markers and the clinical condition of the patient will be evaluated at each time\n      point to determine which combination of imaging markers best describe the current clinical\n      status of the patient and which markers best predict a patient's outcome status.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Age 18 or older\n          -  Evidence of external head injury or facial trauma, or mechanism of injury consistent\n             with brain trauma, including loss of consciousness or altered mental status.\n          -  Residence within 90 minutes driving time of University of Maryland Medical Center,\n             and willingness to attend follow-up appointments.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  History of white matter disease or neurodegenerative disorders including Multiple\n             Sclerosis, Huntington's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, or Pick's Disease.\n          -  History of Stroke\n          -  History of treatment or diagnosis of psychiatric conditions: Major Depressive\n             Disorder (MDD), Bipolar Disorder (BPD), Schizophrenia, or Dementia of any type.\n          -  History of Brain Tumor\n          -  Status post trauma due to asphyxiation\n          -  Preexisting contraindications for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\n          -  Active Duty Military Status\n          -  Police custody or prisoner status\n          -  Pregnant women\n", "cuis": "C0876926 C3508472 C0011923 C0079595 C1552616 C1706244 C0220901 C0079595 C0947630 C0005516
