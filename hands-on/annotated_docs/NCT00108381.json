{"text": "TITLE:\n      Efficacy of Tailored Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Back Pain\nSUMMARY:\n      This clinical trial compares two psychological treatments for back pain.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The primary objective is to examine the incremental efficacy of a patient-centered and\n      tailored self-management treatment approach, Tailored Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (TCBT), for\n      persons with chronic musculoskeletal pain. TCBT will be compared with a Standard Cognitive-\n      Behavior Therapy (SCBT) condition. The hypothesis is that TCBT will be associated with\n      improved outcomes following treatment. Outcome will be assessed by multiple standardized\n      measures of key domains of the chronic pain experience. Secondary objectives are to examine\n      the process of successful self-management treatment.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Chronic back pain for at least 6 months\n          -  Treatment by medication or physical therapy\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Acute or life threatening physical illness\n          -  Current alcohol or substance abuse or dependence\n          -  Current psychosis or suicidal ideation treatment by anesthesiology, chiropractic care\n             or surgery\n", "cuis": "C0004933 C0179285 C0004604 C1547296 C1555457 C1552616 C1706244 C1096775 C1306597 C0848372 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C0814472 C0004604 C1963071 C0677061 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0243024 C0030677 C0004933 C1551994 C0026858 C0019559 C0023222 C0239377 C0241416 C0476280 C0231749 C0239833 C0741399 C0746816 C0848218 C2828392 C3272550 C0004933 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1561611 C0150055 C0744939 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0018017 C2239270 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0027627 C0030677 C1551994 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0740418 C0457949 C1561542 C0029709 C0949766 C0553651 C0204093 C1948126 C2064714 C2148126 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0243161 C0683323 C1547229 C1547295 C0740858 C0747752 C0013146 C0038577 C0439857 C0086025 C0011546 C0001962 C0001975 C0424000 C0455204 C0344217 C0033975 C0349204 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0580931 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 ", "concepts": "Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral Therapy Units, Back Pain, Chronic, Chronic summary, summary clinical trial, psychological, psychological tic, treatment, treatment, Retreatments, co treatments, back pains, Back pain, midback pain description, prescription, prescription Objective, objective, Objective, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined, patient-centered care management treatment, Behavior Therapy, self MSK: Musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal hip pain, musculoskeletal leg pain, musculoskeletal arm pain, musculoskeletal toe pain, chest musculoskeletal pains, musculoskeletal knee pain, musculoskeletal hand pain, musculoskeletal back pain, musculoskeletal neck pain, musculoskeletal limb pain, Standard, Standard Behavior Therapy, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, Improved chronic pain, chronic pain hip, experience, experience, Inexperience, objective, objective, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined, secondary management treatment, self criteria, Eligibility Criteria Chronic back pain, Chronic low back pain, month physical; therapy, physical therapies, Other physical therapy, other physical therapy, physical therapy care, chest physical therapy, physical therapy goals, Medications, medication:, medications:, Premedication, IV medication, Medications, Medications, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment Criteria physical illness, Acute, Acute rndx substance abuse, multisubstance abuse, substance abuse drug, substance abuse test, dependence on, Codependence, dependency, alcohol, alcohol suicidal ideation, Homicidal ideation, chiropractic, Psychosis, psychosis, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, care surgery, surgery, surgery: "}
