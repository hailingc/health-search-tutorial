{"text": "TITLE:\n      Chest Pain Observation Unit Risk Reduction Trial\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief counseling intervention initiated\n      in the chest pain observation unit has a significant impact upon the health attitudes\n      (readiness to change) and cardiovascular risk-related behaviors (diet, exercise, and\n      smoking) of emergency department patients.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Increasingly, emergency department patients for whom a non-ischemic etiology of ACS symptoms\n      cannot be identified undergo further evaluation to rule out myocardial ischemia and\n      appraisal of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in chest pain observation units (CPOUs).\n      CPOU admission may represent a \"teachable moment,\" but there has been little research on the\n      effectiveness of brief, practical interventions for cardiovascular risk reduction in this\n      population, despite the fact that the vast majority of these patients have at least one\n      modifiable CRF and many do not receive regular primary care follow-up. The purpose of this\n      study is to determine whether a brief counseling intervention initiated in the CPOU has a\n      significant impact upon health attitudes (readiness to change) and cardiovascular\n      risk-related behaviors (diet, exercise, and smoking). Based on the Health Belief Model\n      (HBM), the intervention is designed to provide patients with tailored information on their\n      cardiovascular risk, to negotiate goals for change, and to build problem-solving skills. All\n      participants who are admitted to the CPOU for evaluation of ACS symptoms will be randomized\n      to brief intervention (face-to-face counseling in the CPOU, coupled with telephone\n      counseling at 4 weeks) or to minimal intervention (booklet with general information on CRFs)\n      after a negative initial troponin measurement. We will conduct a baseline survey and\n      follow-up telephone interviews at 2- and 6-month to assess stage of change and CRF-related\n      behaviors. Both adjusted and unadjusted multivariable analyses will be performed to\n      determine the intervention effect (using an intention-to-treat approach). We will also use\n      mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which the intervention is mediated by HBM\n      constructs (e.g., perceived susceptibility to cardiovascular adverse events, perceived\n      benefit of risk reduction, perceived barriers, self-efficacy). The proposed trial will\n      evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering brief interventions for\n      cardiovascular risk reduction in the CPOU setting, will provide insight into mechanisms of\n      behavior change in these patients, and will guide the development of future case management\n      interventions.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  At least one modifiable cardiovascular risk factor (smoking, hyperlipidemia,\n             hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity)\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients who \"rule-in\" for myocardial ischemia at initial testing\n          -  Terminally ill (expected to survive less than 3 months)\n          -  Unavailable for 6-month follow-up\n          -  Cannot be contacted by telephone\n          -  Institutionalized persons (prisoners, nursing home residents)\n          -  Unable to provide informed consent (impaired mental status, unable to speak English)\n", "cuis":
