{"text": "TITLE:\n      Thromboprophylaxis in Pregnant Women in Hospital: A Prospective Clinical Trial\nSUMMARY:\n      Hospitalization in pregnancy and childbirth greatly increases the thromboembolic risk of\n      these patients. The application of a protocol for assessing the risk of VTE reduces\n      mortality and morbidity of these phenomena.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Thromboembolic events are among the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in\n      pregnancy / postpartum period. They are the leading cause of maternal death in developed\n      countries. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) during pregnancy and postpartum as\n      family history or personal history of VTE, thrombophilia, age over 35, obesity and high\n      parity has been the most studied. One of the main risk factors is hospitalization, which\n      increases up to 20 times the risk of VTE.\n      Objective: The objective of the study is to identify early risk factors for VTE in\n      hospitalized pregnant women and institute appropriate prophylaxis to reduce the incidence\n      and morbidity.\n      Methods: A prospective study that will evaluate all pregnant women admitted for clinical\n      treatment and / or surgery in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Clinics Hospital,\n      University of S\u00e3o Paulo through the application of a thromboprophylaxis protocol with risk\n      assessment score. The patient in whom prophylaxis would be indicated are those with scores\n      greater than or equal to 3. The drug to be used is enoxaparin and the dose to be used\n      depends on the weight of the patient.\n      It will be further assessed: adverse effects of treatment with enoxaparin, protocol failure\n      in the group treated and untreated (without anticoagulation) and bleeding incidence in the\n      untreated group.\n      Risk score description: score 3 - previous thrombosis/thromboembolism, homozygous mutations,\n      combined thrombophilia risk factors, antiphospholipid syndrome, cancer(stomach, pancreas,\n      lung), inflammatory conditions, lupus, sickle cell disease, nephrotic syndrome, heart\n      disease; Score 2 - Protein C deficiency, Protein S deficiency, heterozygous F5 Leiden,\n      heterozygous F2 G20210A mutation, cancer(last 6 months), chemotherapy(last 6m), immobility,\n      bed rest >4d prior to C-section, current serious infections, BMI\u226540 kg/m2 , age\u226540y, lung\n      disease(cyanosis), postpartum hemorrhage >1L; Score 1 - age \u2265 35 and \u226439 y, parity \u22653,\n      multiple pregnancy, hyperemesis, gross varicose veins, smoker \u226520, surgical procedure.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  All pregnant women hospitalized.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Previous use of anticoagulation\n", "cuis": "C1096775 C0549206 C1552616 C1706244 C0019993 C3840878 C3841837 C3841838 C0005615 C0011209 C0581135 C1148523 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0040038 C0185125 C0376495 C1947919 C2347934 C0185026 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0220880 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0040038 C0220880 C1858460 C0721591 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C1858460 C0721591 C0025344 C0011065 C1306577 C2363670 C0040038 C0455533 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0455624 C1553898 C2360662 C0262926 C0424945 C0241889 C0332123 C1397163 C1397164 C2584882 C0398623 C1861171 C0028754 C0019993 C3840878 C3841837 C3841838 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0030563 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0018017 C2979883 C2239270 C0947630 C3858576 C0701159 C0033107 C0199176 C3853787 C0740413 C0549206 C0220880 C0549206 C0184666 C0809949 C0025663 C2827714 C2828387 C0947630 C0220825 C3272565 C0587597 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0185125 C0376495 C1947919 C2347934 C0185026 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0033107 C0199176 C3853787 C0740413 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C1444656 C0206460 C0013227 C1254351 C0424653 C1305866 C2053618 C0725813 C0879626 C0559546 C0853204 C0206460 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0003281 C2917212 C3537050 C0332155 C0019080 C1552839 C0332155 C1552839 C0040038 C0455533 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0040053 C2586211 C0302148 C2321417 C0085278 C0409980 C2930802 C0398623 C1861171 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0030274 C0771711 C0702058 C0347284 C0869826 C1278931 C0002895 C0027726 C0027730 C0027729 C0024131 C0024138 C0024141 C0409974 C0018787 C0024109 C0012634 C0442743 C0003209 C0398625 C0033626 C0242666 C0012634 C0018609 C4050231 C2322218 C0231441 C0425245 C1561542 C3714514 C0009450 C0275524 C2707258 C0729555 C0747002 C0007876 C1552858 C0004910 C0024109 C0032797 C0475173 C0269899 C0473508 C0030563 C4050231 C0032989 C1716484 C0455436 C0404848 C0543467 C1391251 C3846422 C0026035 C0038904 C0524850 C0524861 C3874032 C0042345 C3873440 C0155778 C0455534 C0235250 C0020450 C0337664 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0701159 C0549206 C0243161 C0003281 C2917212 C3537050 ", "concepts": "Clinical Trial, Pregnant summary, summary Hospitalization NOS, Hospitalization 1, Hospitalization 3, Hospitalization 2, childbirth, childbirth, childbirth, childbirth, pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy, thromboembolism applications, Reapplication, Application, Application, plication, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol morbidity description, prescription, prescription Thromboembolic events, morbidity, maternal, materna pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy, maternal, materna, period, deaths, death, developer thromboembolism, H/O: thromboembolism, pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy, risk factors, risk factors, Risk factors Doc personal history, personal history, family history, No family history, family history;
