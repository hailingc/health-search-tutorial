{"text": "TITLE:\n      Safety and Feasibility of Endovascular Cooling Device in Patients With Hypothermic Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation\nSUMMARY:\n      Hypothermic resuscitation is proven to be benefit to the cardiac origin cardiac arrest\n      patients for it improve brain recovery dramatically. However, traditional cooling devices\n      and methods, most external cooling methods, include ice blanket, cooling helmet, or ice\n      packing lower the body temperature slowly or inefficiently which make many emergency\n      physicians hesitate to perform hypothermic resuscitation. To improve and promote the\n      practice of hypothermia resuscitation, more efficient temperature control method is\n      necessary. We conduct this clinical trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of internal\n      cooling catheter and temperature regulatory device, which is approved by FDA in neurologic\n      ICU for temperature control, in the cardiac arrest patients.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      We recruited successful resuscitated nontraumatic cardiac arrest adult patients in the\n      emergency department to evaluate the safety and feasibility of application those invasive\n      internal temperature regulator devices. Internal cooling catheter, \"ICY\" , and thermal\n      regulator device, \"Coolguard 2000\" are applied to the patients from femoral vein. WE\n      definite 4 stages according to the temperature during the clinical trial: \"The Cooling\n      Phase\", \"Hypothermia phase\", \"Rewarming phase\", and \"Postrewarming phase\". The temperature\n      is lowed or elevated by the rate 0.5C/hr during the Cooling and Rewarming Phase, and it is\n      maintained 33 +/- 1 C during hypothermia phase for 12 hours according to the comment of\n      ACLS. To understand the safety and feasibility, regular blood sampling, bedside EEG and\n      vital monitors, and special sheets are designed to document the every reasons, time points\n      or every clinical events during hypothermia therapy. The patients is observed until\n      rewarming finish for 48 hours or till death if expired during post-resuscitation hypothermia\n      therapy.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Non-traumatic collapsed patients, whose pulsation continues and persists more than 5\n             minutes after return of spontaneous circulation from cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n             and consciousness level is less than GCS 5 points.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  1. Age > 78 y/o or < 18 y/o 2. Core temperature< 34\u2103or > 38 \u2103 after resuscitation 3.\n             Pregnancy 4. Underline terminal malignancy disorder or refuse aggressive treatment\n             cancer patient 5. Massive bleeding, known coagulopathy, or received regular\n             anticoagulant medication 6. Persisted hypotension ( mean arterial BP < 60 mmHg) after\n             resuscitation even under inotropic agents 7. No bed available in ICU\n", "cuis": "C0007203 C0183001 C0199468 C3881288 C0025080 C3887560 C0027873 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0524425 C0020672 C0020673 C0413252 C1963170
