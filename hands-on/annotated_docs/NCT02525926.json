{"text": "TITLE:\n      Pulmonary Artery Denervation for Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension\nSUMMARY:\n      Pulmonary hypertension is a rare condition that leads to right ventricular dysfunction and\n      premature death. Only modest improvements of outcomes have been observed with the current\n      available advanced specific drug therapy. Pulmonary hypertension advanced therapy is also\n      expensive and leads to frequent adverse effects, sometimes serious. Results from a pilot\n      study, the first-in-man experience of pulmonary artery denervation, demonstrated a clinical\n      improvement in 13 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension despite optimal medical\n      management. However this single non-randomized study requires confirmation.\n      The investigators propose a prospective multi-center, randomized, single-blinded trial. Its\n      main objective will be to assess, in patients with uncontrolled pulmonary hypertension\n      despite optimal medical management, the efficacy of pulmonary artery denervation in reducing\n      mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) at six months, compared to continued medical treatment\n      following a simulated (sham) procedure.\n      The principal evaluation criteria will be the mPAP change (in mm Hg) as measured by right\n      heart catheterization.\n      The study will run for 18 months and it will be necessary to recruit 50 patients.\n      All adult patients (with the exception of pregnant women and individuals unable to receive\n      an appropriate information and to give their free and informed consent) with uncontrolled\n      pulmonary arterial hypertension despite optimal medical management will be invited to\n      participate, in the absence of any exclusion criteria.\n      The investigators will also measure changes in clinical, biological, echocardiographic and\n      hemodynamic prognostic markers in both groups.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients with pulmonary artery hypertension (group 1 of the Nice classification of\n             pulmonary hypertension)\n               -  Aged over 18 years old\n               -  NYHA class III or IV\n               -  Not controlled by optimal medical management as defined by:\n                    -  dual therapy including a prostacyclin.\n                    -  or dual therapy including an endothelin receptor antagonist and a\n               -  5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors, in patients with contra-indication of\n                  prostacyclin, poor tolerance to this treatment, prostacyclin derivative\n                  treatment failure or patient refusal.\n               -  Valid status in the social security system\n               -  Signed informed consent\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patient eligible for pulmonary transplantation\n          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding\n          -  Adults of the age of majority subject to guardianship court order or deprived of\n             liberty\n          -  Patient with history of radio frequency procedure\n          -  Known heparin allergy\n", "cuis": "C0034052 C0226069 C0226054 C0020538 C1963138 C3248638 C0947663 C0085580 C0455405 C1696708 C3829824 C0011307 C1321798 C1522415 C0858951 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C2707265 C0024109 C0041327 C0003842 C1552616 C1706244 C0242973 C0242698 C0242707 C3532309 C3532312 C0020542 C1963220 C3807623 C4013136 C0152171 C1868851 C1556305 C1556306 C1556307 C1556308 C1556309 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0181586 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0011065 C1306577 C1720467 C0151526 C0020542 C1963220 C3807623 C4013136 C0152171 C1868851 C1556305 C1556306 C1556307 C1556308 C1556309 C0013216 C0599938 C1552740 C0087111 C0033972 C0879626 C0559546 C0853204 C0181586 C2825142 C0034052 C1269026 C0545747 C0226069 C0923925 C1269883 C0489875 C0003861 C0226054 C0923924 C1269884 C0503867 C0011307 C1321798 C0858951 C1522415 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0947630 C3272565 C0020542 C1963220 C1868851 C0152171 C3203102 C3807623 C1306232 C3844714 C1611825 C0376636 C0087136 C0723338 C0947630 C3245501 C3245502 C0087136 C0723338 C0404831 C0018792 C0020542 C1963220 C1868851 C0152171 C3203102 C3807623 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0034052 C1269026 C0545747 C0226069 C0923925 C1269883 C0489875 C0003861 C0226054 C0923924 C1269884 C0503867 C0011307 C1321798 C0858951 C1522415 C0376636 C0428642 C2008312 C1168098 C0034094 C3805917 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1561542 C1444662 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0935549 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0018795 C0189897 C0189896 C0261518 C0481236 C0497083 C0947630 C0600140 C1561542 C0549206 C1299582 C0009797 C3242430 C1561528 C0020538 C0264648 C0020649 C0376636 C0024109 C2707265 C0243161 C0424530 C0183129 C0013516 C1548762 C3272559 C3272565 C0220901 C1552839 C0005516 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0034052 C1269026 C0545747 C0226069 C0923925 C1269883 C0489875 C0003861 C0226054 C0923924 C1269884 C0503867 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0441861 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0444594 C0457356 C0596463 C1275491 C0020542 C1963220 C1868851 C0152171 C3203102 C3807623 C0456387 C0376636 C0180112 C2911690 C0033567 C0205911 C2825061 C0699125 C0087111 C0033972 C1134681 C1516869 C0087111 C0033972 C0031638 C3539996 C1318700 C2936609 C4049968 C1301624 C0033567 C0205911 C2825061 C0699125 C0220929 C0231197 C0231199 C1547317 C1744706 C0013220 C0020963 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0606968 C0162643 C3242233 C0810533 C1519316 C0009797 C0243161 C0040732 C0597409 C0040736 C0040739 C0520484 C0596557 C0935850 C0005976 C0024128 C0037297 C0206153 C0242602 C0596842 C0843447 C1293198 C1293536 C0024109 C2707265 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0006147 C1623040 C1623041 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C1522411 C3244315 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0262926 C2004062 C0034546 C2347273 C3898838 C0571776 C0571778 ", "concepts": "Pulmonary Artery, Left Pulmonary Artery, Right Pulmonary Artery, Hypertension NOS, Hypertension, Hypertension mg, Hypertensin, Hypertension NOS, FH: Hypertension, Pre-Hypertension, Has Hypertension, denervation, denervation, Denervation, enervation, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Pulmonary, pulmonary, Pulmonary TB, Arterial summary, summary ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction, Right ventricular dysfunction, Fetal ventricular dysfunction, Fetal biventricular dysfunction, PHT -
