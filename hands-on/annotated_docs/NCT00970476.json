{"text": "TITLE:\n      Response To Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy In Heart Failure: Role Of Arterial Stiffness\nSUMMARY:\n      To determine if arterial stiffness as measured by non-invasive pulse wave velocity can\n      predict the response to resynchronization therapy in heart failure.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The patients receiving CRT are medically refractory, symptomatic, NYHA class III or IV\n      disease and QRS duration of 130 m sec or greater, and a left ventricular ejection fraction\n      of 30 percent or less.\n      The pulse wave velocity between carotid and femoral (PWVcf) will be recorded in each subject\n      at base line (before and after CRT), at one month (after AV delay optimization) and again at\n      6 months after CRT. The arterial pulse wave is recorded at a proximal artery, such as the\n      carotid artery, and as well as at a distal artery, such as the femoral artery. The\n      superficial location of the carotid and femoral arteries means that their pulse waveforms\n      are readily measured noninvasively using the M Hz Doppler probe, and between these two sites\n      the pulse wave has to travel through most of the aorta. The time delay between the arrival\n      of a predefined part of the pulse wave, such as the foot, at these 2 points is obtained by\n      gating to the peak of the R-wave of the ECG. The distance traveled by the pulse wave is\n      measured over the body surface and PWV is then calculated as distance/time (m/s).\n      Clinical evidence of response: Either one or more of the following: 1) Improvement in NYHA\n      functional classification, 2) Improvement in 6 minute walking distance. 3) Change in\n      functional class, exercise tolerance while the heart is getting smaller on CXR. 4)\n      Stabilization of patient CHF even without subjective improvement over 6 months (remaining\n      class III rather than progressive to class IV). Imaging evidence of response: 1) Increase in\n      left ventricular ejection fraction. 2) Reduction of mitral regurgitation. 3) Reduction of LV\n      volume signifying reverse remodeling.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  The patients receiving CRT are medically refractory, symptomatic, NYHA class III or\n             IV disease and QRS duration of 130 m sec or greater, and a left ventricular ejection\n             fraction of 30 percent or less.\n          -  All individuals are carefully selected after appropriate clinical evaluation as\n             determined by the treating physicians to exclude possible reversible causes of heart\n             failure.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and non-palpable carotid and/or femoral\n             pulses will be excluded due to technical limitations of the procedure used for the\n             measurement of arterial stiffness.\n", "cuis": "C1167956 C1322645 C2936377 C1322648 C0599949 C0018801 C0018802 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C1552616 C1706244 C0599949 C0034107 C0391850 C1334278 C0018801 C0018802 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0087111 C0033972 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0456387 C0231221 C0042508 C0428772 C0428781 C1736907 C2733342 C2733341 C0488377 C0012634 C0018609 C0741968 C0015811 C0034107 C0391850 C0182913 C1561542 C0003842 C0034107 C0391850 C1561542 C0182913 C0007272 C0162859 C3508150 C0015801 C1280173 C0226448 C1281581 C0226455 C0003842 C0015801 C1555588 C1515974 C0741968 C0034107 C0391850 C0441086 C1555670 C0034107 C0391850 C0003483 C0034107 C0391850 C0016504 C0034107 C0391850 C0152338 C1443182 C1441792 C3272565 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C3844638 C2346415 C2368355 C0444594 C0457356 C0596463 C1275491 C0031843 C0886384 C0162521 C2024889 C2709256 C0015260 C3149603 C0424551 C0456387 C0018787 C0039985 C0031843 C1293130 C2266644 C2979880 C3844714 C1561542 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0011923 C0079595 C0456387 C3839460 C0042508 C0428772 C0428781 C1736907 C2733342 C2733341 C0026266 C1298807 C0746597 C0441610 C3849973 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0456387 C0231221 C0488377 C0018827 C0012634 C0018609 C0429585 C0430943 C1290755 C0040597 C1554103 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C3272565 C1552867 C0018787 C0243161 C0004238 C0344434 C1963067 C2926591 C0340489 C0729790 C1281999 C0741968 C0015811 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C1552867 C0034107 C0391850 C0599949 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 ", "concepts": "Cardiac Resynchronization Pacing Therapy, Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Leads, Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Devices, Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemakers, Arterial Stiffness, Heart Failure, Heart Failure, response, Response, Response summary, summary arterial stiffness, pulse, pulse, Invasive heart failures, Heart failure, Response, Response, Response, therapy, Cotherapy description, prescription, prescription class, Asymptomatic ventricular ejection fraction, Left ventricular ejection fraction, Right ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, Left ventricular ejection, Right ventricular ejection, QRS duration, disease, h disease carotid, femoral, pulse, pulse, recorder month Arterial, pulse, pulse, month, recorder carotid arteries, Carotid artery, pta carotid artery, femoral arteries, Femoral artery, Left femoral artery, Left femoral artery, Deep femoral artery, artery femoral arteries, location, Location, carotid, pulse, pulse Doppler probe travel, pulse, pulse, aorta pulse, pulse, foot pulse, pulse body, Calculated, US.calculated Clinical, Response, Response, Response, Either walking, walking, Gass classification, Kiel classification, drug classification, nyha classification, function, 5 minute Exercise tolerance, exercise tolerance, Exercise tolerance, exercise tolerance test, Poor exercise tolerance, exercise intolerance, class, heart, cxr, function Stabilization, subjective, Subjective, No improvement, month Response, Response, Response, Imaging, Imaging, class, Nonprogressive ventricular ejection fraction, Left ventricular ejection fraction, Right ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, Left ventricular ejection, Right ventricular ejection, mitral regurgitation, Acute mitral regurgitation, mitral regurgitation murmur, Reduction remodelin criteria, Eligibility Criteria class, Asymptomatic QRS duration, ventricular, disease, h disease refraction, Refraction, Abfraction, Traction, Fraction Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, Clinical exclude, heart Criteria atrial fibrillation (AF), ECG: atrial fibrillation, Atrial fibrillation, Atrial fibrillation, Lone atrial fibrillation, H/O: atrial fibrillation, Rapid atrial fibrillation, carotid, femoral, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure, exclude, pulse, pulse arterial stiffness, ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement "}
