{"text": "TITLE:\n      BES, EES, and ZES-R in Real World Practice\nSUMMARY:\n      The primary objective of this study is to compare the rate of device-oriented composite\n      consisted of cardiac death, myocardial infarction not clearly attributable to a nontarget\n      vessel, and clinically indicated target lesion revascularization among the patients treated\n      with EES, ZES-R, or BES at 24-month clinical follow-up post-index procedure. Trial end\n      points are summarized in Table I. The hypothesis is that BES is equivalent to EES or BES is\n      equivalent to ZES-R at the primary end point.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Previous randomized trials have shown the superior efficacy of drug-eluting stents (DES),\n      such as sirolimus-eluting stent (SES, CYPHER, Cordis, US), paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES,\n      TAXUS, Boston Scientific, US), and zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES, Endeavor, Medtronic, US)\n      compared with bare metal stents (BMS) by reducing neointimal hyperplasia, late luminal loss,\n      and angiographic restenosis leading to decreased target lesion revascularization.\n      Unfortunately, restenosis still occurs and late stent thrombosis can develop by delaying\n      endoluminal healing or by chronic inflammation.Accordingly, development of new DES is\n      required to improve efficacy by reducing revascularization and safety by reducing the risk\n      of stent thrombosis. With the improvement of polymer, drug, and the platform, the 2nd\n      generation DES, including everolimus-eluting stent (EES, Xience V or Xience Prime, Abbott,\n      USA), zotarolimus-eluting stent with biolinx polymer (ZES-R, Endeavor Resolute or Endeavor\n      Resolute Integrity, Medtronic, USA), and biolimus-eluting stent (BES, BioMatrix or Biomatrix\n      Flex, Biosensors, USA), have been shown to be superior or non-inferior in safety and\n      efficacy trials compared with 1st generation DES.\n      However, it is difficult to know if there are any differences in efficacy and safety between\n      the EES, the ZES-R, and the BES, in real world practice due to the lack of data comparing\n      these three 2nd generation DES directly. This study provides the evidence for the CHOICE of\n      stent when physicians are treating patients by percutaneous coronary intervention.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria\n          -  Age > 19 years\n          -  Subject is able to verbally confirm understanding of risks, benefits and treatment\n             alternatives of receiving the drug-eluting stent(s) and he/she or his/her legally\n             authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any study\n             related procedure\n          -  Subject must have significant stenosis (>50% by visual estimate) on a native or\n             in-stent coronary artery\n          -  Subject must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable, unstable angina,\n             recent infarction, acute myocardial infarction, positive functional study or a\n             reversible changes in the ECG consistent with ischemia). In subjects with coronary\n             artery stenosis >75%, evidence of myocardial ischemia does not have to be documented\n        Exclusion Criteria\n          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following\n             medications: heparin, aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, biolimus A9,\n             everolimus, zotarolimus, stainless steel, cobalt chromium, contrast media (Patients\n             with documented sensitivity to contrast media, which can be effectively premedicated\n             with steroid and diphenhydramine may be enrolled. However, those with true\n             anaphylaxis to prior contrast media should not be enrolled.)\n          -  Subject in use of systemic (intravenous) biolimus A9, everolimus or zotarolimus\n             within 12 months.\n          -  Female subject of childbearing potential, unless a recent pregnancy test is negative,\n             who possibly plans to become pregnant any time after enrollment into this study\n          -  Subject planned an elective surgical procedure that would necessitate interruption of\n             antiplatelet during the first 12 months post enrollment\n          -  Subject with non-cardiac co-morbid condition with life expectancy < 2 year or that\n             may result in protocol non-compliance (per site investigator's medical judgment)\n          -  Subject with cardiogenic shock at presentation\n          -  Subject who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational\n             study, who have not completed the primary end point follow-up period\n", "cuis": "C0237607 C3245512 C1552616 C1706244 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0947630 C1961028 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727
