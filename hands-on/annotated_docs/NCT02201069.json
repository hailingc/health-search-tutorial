{"text": "TITLE:\n      My Health Coach Study\nSUMMARY:\n      The \"My Health Coach Study\" seeks to determine if health coaching by a medical assistant can\n      help patients have better sleep, a better diet, be more physically active or lose weight,\n      according to the recommendation of their health care provider.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The aim of the study is to determine whether medical assistants (MAs) can assist primary\n      care providers to achieve healthier lifestyles via better sleep, food choices, weight loss\n      and/or increased physical activity in their patients. The hypothesis driving this research\n      is that health coaching can be done by existing medical support staff to facilitate healthy\n      lifestyles in a primary care setting. Coaching can maximize the health of the patient\n      population in a cost-effective way if the coaching service is integrated into primary care\n      clinics with minimal capital investment at the outset. A major focus will be on behaviors\n      associated with weight management since this is the most common health issue in the U.S.\n      today. This method, if successful, should be easily adaptable to other health behaviors and\n      in most any medical practice that seeks to improve the health of its patient base in a\n      cost-effective way.\n      In order to achieve a change in health behaviors, and especially weight loss, regular\n      follow-up contacts are needed. Previous research has shown health coaching to be effective,\n      but this has utilized programs that \"add on\" to the existing clinic structure. This type of\n      coaching model is difficult to sustain. Utilizing existing staff for health coaching is a\n      method we propose to more fully integrate this service into primary care clinics.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  adults age 21 and over\n          -  referred by primary care physician for health coaching\n          -  have telephone for follow-up\n          -  English speaking\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  pregnant or trying to become pregnant\n", "cuis": "C0947630 C1328956 C2718080 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C1328956 C2718080 C0556453 C1262477 C2242973 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C1552861 C0012159 C1549512 C0086388 C1555587 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0557034 C0947630 C1262477 C0424641 C2911645 C0041667 C3665346 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C0580931 C3540798 C1555587 C4039165 C3694428 C0851792 C1551040 C0033137 C3887804 C0033137 C1626409 C0677505 C3826621 C0920298 C3245511 C1547928 C0677505 C0025663 C0025664 C0237607 C3245512 C1262477 C0424641 C2911645 C0041667 C3665346 C0677505 C1522411 C3244315 C2051501 C3162281 C0376691 C3853906 C1551040 C1299586 C0033137 C0025663 C0025664 C1626409 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0033137 C0804815 C1550488 C1554180 C1576871 C1626258 C3273808 C3540738 C0243161 C0549206 ", "concepts": "Study, eHealth, mHealth summary, summary Study, eHealth, mHealth physically active, lose weight, lose weight, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, help, diet, diet health care, provider description, prescription, prescription assist, study Weight loss, height loss, Weight loss, weight low, sight loss, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, care, food, provider Increased physical activity, increase in physical activity, Increased physical activity levels staff primary care, upsetting primary care, Inservice behaviors, Capital investments weight management, common, Tissue behaviors, method, methods practices, practice Weight loss, height loss, Weight loss, weight low, sight loss, behaviors, Border, orders follow-up contact, follow-up contact: son Programs model, staff, difficulty primary care, method, methods, Inservice criteria, Eligibility Criteria primary care, Physician, referrer, Deferred Telephone, Telephone, Telephone English Criteria pregnant "}
