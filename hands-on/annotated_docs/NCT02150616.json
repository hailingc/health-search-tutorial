{"text": "TITLE:\n      Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension or Interstitial Lung Disease at Altitude - Effect of Oxygen on Breathing and Sleep\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of travelling to moderate altitude\n      and of nocturnal oxygen therapy during a stay at moderate altitude on breathing and sleep of\n      patients with pulmonary hypertension or with interstitial lung disease.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Patients with pulmonary hypertension or with interstitial lung disease living below 800 m\n      will be invited to participate in a randomized, cross-over field trial evaluating the\n      hypotheses that: a), breathing and sleep during a 2 day sojourn at moderate altitude are\n      impaired in comparison to low altitude; b), breathing and sleep during a 2 day sojourn at\n      moderate altitude are improved by nocturnal oxygen therapy compared to room air (sham\n      oxygen) administered during nights at altitude. Outcomes will be assessed at low altitude\n      (Zurich, 490 m, baseline), and during 2 study periods of 2 days each spent at moderate\n      altitude (St. Moritz Salastrains, 2048 m), separated by a wash-out period of at least 2\n      weeks spent at low altitude (<800 m). The order of stays at the different altitudes and of\n      the treatments will be randomized.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Precapillary pulmonary hypertension, or interstitial lung disease.\n          -  New York Heart Association class 2-3.\n          -  Residence at low altitude (<800m).\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Unstable or exacerbated condition\n          -  Very severe pulmonary hypertension or interstitial lung disease, New York Heart\n             Association class 4\n          -  requirement for oxygen therapy at low altitude residence\n          -  hypoventilation\n          -  more than mild or unstable cardiovascular disease\n          -  use of drugs that affect respiratory center drive\n          -  internal, neurologic or psychiatric disease that interfere with protocol compliance\n             including current heavy smoking (>20 cigarettes per day), inability to perform 6 min\n             walk test.\n          -  previous intolerance to moderate altitude (<2600m).\n          -  Exposure to altitudes >1500m for >2 days within the last 4 weeks before the study.\n          -  Pregnant or nursing patients\n", "cuis": "C0206062 C1881236 C0020542 C0152171 C3203102 C1963220 C0035203 C0004048 C2015926 C1649428 C0030054 C0184633 C2359957 C0134413 C0037313 C0723362 C0013144 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C1649428 C0184633 C1546419 C0418996 C1960973 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C1649428 C0206062 C2215135 C0340097 C0746105 C3278284 C0020542 C1963220 C1868851 C0152171 C3203102 C3807623 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0206062 C2215135 C0340097 C0746105 C3278284 C0020542 C1963220 C1868851 C0152171 C3203102 C3807623 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1553496 C0018792 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C1561538 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C1649428 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C1550472 C1561538 C1649428 C0184633 C1546419 C0418996 C1960973 C3536832 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C1649428 C1561611 C0030054 C0184633 C1550472 C1649428 C0025344 C0947630 C0728774 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C0086972 C0025344 C1649428 C1550472 C1522411 C3244315 C1649428 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C0814472 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C3696954 C1283386 C0206062 C2215135 C0340097 C0746105 C3278284 C0004083 C0086168 C0441886 C0018787 C0153500 C0153957 C1281570 C1550472 C3840630 C3843911 C3843912 C1649428 C0243161 C0436331 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0443343 C0206062 C2215135 C0340097 C0746105 C3278284 C0020542 C1963220 C1868851 C0152171 C3203102 C3807623 C4050419 C0018787 C0153500 C0153957 C1281570 C0004083 C0086168 C0441888 C0184633 C1546419 C0418996 C1960973 C1550472 C0000916 C0417648 C3203358 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0558373 C0849932 C0264656 C0042373 C0443343 C0035216 C0001721 C2237113 C0013227 C0013126 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0012634 C0018609 C1548428 C3526598 C3714738 C0376405 C3244072 C1561538 C3845546 C0392366 C0456984 C0231199 C1744706 C1547317 C0220929 C0231197 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C1649428 C0274281 C0332157 C2220266 C0947630 C0549206 C0028678 ", "concepts": "Interstitial Lung Disease, Interstitial Disease, Pulmonary hypertensions, Primary Pulmonary Hypertension, Primary Pulmonary Hypertension, Pulmonary hypertension, breathing, Breathing in, breathing, Altitude, Oxygen, Oxygen, Oxygen, Oxygent, Sleep, Sleep, Sleepy, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary study, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate, Altitude oxygen therapies, Oxygen therapy, LT oxygen therapy, Home oxygen therapy, in breathing, Breathing, breathing, Rebreathing, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate, Altitude ILD -
