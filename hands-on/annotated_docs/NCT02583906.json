{"text": "TITLE:\n      Sleep Disordered Breathing in Precapillary Pulmonary Hypertension: Effect of CPAP Treatment\nSUMMARY:\n      Evaluation of the effect of CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure ) treatment in PAH\n      (pulmonary arterial hypertension) and CTEPH (chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension)\n      patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the effect of CPAP therapy on pulmonary\n      vascular resistance in PAH and CTEPH patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing.\n      The secondary endpoints are the effect of CPAP on right atrium and right ventricle diameter\n      and ejection fraction measured by echocardiography, 6 minutes walk distance, NYHA class,\n      QOL, endothelial function, sympathetic activity and prognosis.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  minimum 18 years old\n          -  diagnosed with PAH or non-operable CTEPH or operated CTEPH with peristent pulmonary\n             hypertension\n          -  diagnosis of PAH based on cardiac catherisation\n          -  diagnosis of CTEPH confirmed by contrast-enhanced spiral chest CT, pulmonary\n             angiography and V/Q scintigraphy\n          -  recent diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing (polysomnography realized within 3\n             months before inclusion showing AHI above 15) stable clinical condition for at least\n             3 months before inclusion as defined by NYHA and a walking distance difference within\n             10% of the previous 3 months and no change in medical therapy during this 3 months\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  congenital heart disease\n          -  moderate and severe restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease with a TLC and a\n             FEV1<60% of the predicted value\n          -  BMI 35kg/m2 or more\n          -  patients already treated with CPAP\n          -  patients with severe sleepiness (epworth sleepiness scale from 18 to 24/24)\n", "cuis": "C0037315 C0520680 C0020542 C0152171 C3203102 C1963220 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0006901 C0935624 C1552616 C1706244 C0199451 C0454519 C2359935 C3872512 C2960045 C2359936 C0454518 C3476394 C0220825 C1261322 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0020542 C1963220 C1868851 C0152171 C3203102 C3807623 C0020538 C0264648 C0020649 C0024109 C2707265 C0040038 C0037315 C0683278 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C2986535 C0024109 C2707265 C0087111 C0033972 C0947630 C0220825 C0037315 C0042380 C0429119 C4049784 C0683278 C0225883 C1269891 C0225844 C1269890 C0225856 C1280943 C0456956 C1280944 C0027627 C0489482 C2020641 C2700378 C0743400 C1545667 C0180980 C0056085 C0013516 C0183129 C0203378 C0013524 C0203379 C0221533 C0412564 C0456387 C0429886 C0886384 C0033325 C3854082 C0031843 C1705273 C0600075 C3668946 C4049938 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0011900 C1408353 C0024109 C2707265 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0018787 C0007430 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0024109 C2707265 C0202823 C2703057 C0881858 C0449900 C1507248 C0009924 C0034606 C2958619 C0002978 C1536105 C1690968 C0037315 C0162701 C0182339 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C1561542 C3272565 C2346415 C2368355 C0085632 C3842396 C1561542 C0418981 C2069680 C1561542 C0155668 C0243161 C0152021 C0455683 C0265808 C0024115 C0455540 C0034072 C0008569 C0040509 C1306232 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C0332155 C0013144 C0175659 C0349674 C0237849 C0684254 C1306232 ", "concepts": "Sleep Disordered Breathing, Central Sleep Disordered Breathing, Pulmonary hypertensions, Primary Pulmonary Hypertension, Primary Pulmonary Hypertension, Pulmonary hypertension, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, capillary, capillary summary, summary continuous positive airway pressure ventilation, Periodic continuous positive airway pressure, Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), Home continuous positive airway pressure unit, Continuous positive airway pressure titration, Continuous positive airway pressure attachment, Intermittent continuous positive airway pressure, Pressure.continuous positive airway.95%, evaluation, evaluation, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment Pulmonary hypertension, NOS, Pulmonary hypertension, Portopulmonary hypertension, pulmonary primary hypertension, Primary pulmonary hypertension, Pulmonary hypertension, mild, arterial hypertension, Renal arterial hypertension, arterial hypotension, pulmonary, Pulmonary, thromboembolism sleep disordered breathing, suffering description, prescription, prescription primary endpoint, pulmonary, Pulmonary, therapy, Cotherapy, study, Evaluate sleep disordered breathing, resistance vascular, resistance vascular, Vascular resistance, suffering right ventricles, Right ventricle, right atrium, Right atrium, Mid right atrium, Mid right atrium, Low right atrium, Low right atrium, secondary ejection fraction (EF), ejection fraction, Ejection fraction, Ejection fraction low, Views ejection fraction, Traction frame, Cohn fraction I, echocardiogram, echocardiographs, 3D Echocardiography, 2D Echocardiography, 4D Echocardiography, cardiography, Fetal echocardiography, class, Walk distance, 5 minutes prognosis, Prognosis, function, Function, Activity, Activity, Activity criteria, Eligibility Criteria diagnosed, Undiagnosed, pulmonary, Pulmonary hypertension, Hypertension, Prehypertensions, No hypertension, hypertensin diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, cardiac, catheterisation diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, pulmonary, Pulmonary, chest CT, chest CTA, Chest CT, contrasted, W contrast, Contrast scintigraphy, sap scintigraphy, angiography, CT angiography, US angiography sleep disordered breathing, polysomnogram, Polysomnographs, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, month, Clinical walking, walking, Indifference, No difference, month Medical therapy, medical therapy, month, previous MI Criteria CHD -
