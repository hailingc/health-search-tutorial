{"text": "TITLE:\n      Femoral Arterial Access With Ultrasound Trial\nSUMMARY:\n      This study is designed to evaluate the routine use of vascular ultrasound as an aid for\n      proper placement of a femoral arterial sheath during cardiac catheterization and peripheral\n      arterial angiography.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Cardiac catheterization is conventionally performed with femoral arterial access using a\n      combination of arterial pulse palpation, anatomical landmarks, and fluoroscopic landmarks to\n      guide needle insertion. Vascular access complications including hematoma formation,\n      retroperitoneal bleeding, and arterial dissection are the most common types of adverse\n      events associated with cardiac catheterization, and have been associated with insertions\n      above and below the level of the common femoral artery. Real-time ultrasound assistance for\n      central venous catheter placement has been proven in multiple studies to reduce\n      complications, and has been recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as\n      a \"Top 11 Highly Proven\" patient safety practice. This recommendation has not yet been\n      extended to arterial access, due to a lack of studies to date. However, ultrasound\n      assistance is licensed for and commonly utilized for arterial access, especially in\n      difficult patients.\n      In a pilot study of 71 procedures performed by the lead researcher, ultrasound guidance was\n      associated with an improved 1st pass success rate (83% vs 47%, p=0.002), reduced risk of\n      accidental venipunctures (0% vs 25%, p=0.002), and greater overall success in common femoral\n      artery cannulation (89% vs 69%, p=0.048) as compared with the fluoroscopic control.\n      This study is a multicenter prospective randomized trial to generalize the above findings\n      with more patients studied, a larger number of operators, and across several centers.\n      Similar to the previous study, the ultrasound will be used real-time to visualize the\n      femoral vein, femoral artery, and needle tract as the needle is inserted, to guide the\n      needle towards the appropriate location in the artery. The time for insertion, number of\n      passes, complications, and position of the insertion catheter on the femoral angiogram will\n      be analyzed in the setting of patient factors including age, body mass index, and presence\n      of peripheral vascular disease.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Adults age 18 and over\n          -  Patients undergoing left heart catheterization or peripheral arterial angiography\n             from the retrograde femoral approach\n          -  Willingness and ability to sign consent form\n          -  Scheduled to have procedure performed by operator trained in the ultrasound technique\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Access from a site other than the common femoral artery\n          -  Nonpalpable femoral pulses\n          -  Creatinine > 3.0 mg/dl, unless already on dialysis\n          -  Prisoners\n          -  Pregnant women\n          -  Unable or refusal to sign consent form\n          -  Patients undergoing emergent cardiac catheterization for ST segment elevation\n             myocardial infarction or unstable acute coronary syndrome\n          -  Equipment unavailable\n", "cuis": "C0041618 C2368378 C1547995 C0003842 C0015811 C1966209 C1552616 C1706244 C0948543 C1456025 C0412512 C0947630 C0220825 C0018795 C0261588 C2007122 C2008028 C2024151 C2183227 C1542709 C2023616 C2023644 C2023645 C2023814 C0179700 C2023568 C0801759 C2008021 C0441587 C0035139 C1555302 C1533810 C0012725 C0015811 C0003842 C0002978 C1536105 C1690968 C0003842 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0018795 C0261588 C0179700 C0801759 C2007122 C2008028 C2024151 C2183227 C1542709 C1547981 C1548828 C0740320 C2023616 C2023644 C2023645 C2023814 C0740321 C0015811 C0003842 C0504075 C0030247 C2024831 C0034107 C0391850 C3539181 C3539182 C3539954 C3539955 C3539956 C3539957 C3539959 C3539960 C3539961 C3539962 C3539963 C3539964 C3539965 C3539966 C3539967 C3539968 C3539969 C3539970 C3539971 C3539972 C3539973 C3539974 C3539975 C3539976 C3539977 C3539978 C3539979 C3540026 C3540027 C3540028 C3540030 C3540031 C3540719 C3540720 C3540721 C3540722 C3540723 C3540724 C3540740 C3854036 C3811910 C0052142 C0251244 C0965970 C0016356 C0180921 C0003842 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0441587 C0035139 C0005847 C0042383 C0018944 C1962958 C0027551 C0007431 C0398266 C0398296 C1561528 C0002949 C1135209 C3242448 C0019080 C0229802 C0267771 C0018795 C0261588 C2007122 C2008028 C2024151 C2183227 C1542709 C2023616 C2023644 C2023645 C2023814 C0179700 C2023568 C0801759 C2008021 C0441587 C0035139 C0015801 C1280173 C0226448 C1281581 C0226455 C0041618 C2368378 C0412555 C3525387 C3245511 C1280910 C1145640 C2026135 C4076189 C0007435 C2026073 C3266130 C3164597 C4071796 C2026142 C2919664 C0441587 C0035139 C1555302 C1533810 C0012725 C0947630 C0700164 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0086388 C1113679 C0237607 C3245512 C0041618 C2368378 C0412555 C3525387 C0947630 C0003842 C1280910 C1548573 C0003842 C1299586 C0442973 C0025664 C0184661 C0947630 C1442948 C1561611 C0600406 C0190979 C1548758 C0863984 C0015811 C3245511 C0000924 C2046386 C2065082 C0849407 C0917707 C0398305 C0003842 C0016356 C0180921 C0947630 C0018792 C2926606 C0041618 C2368378 C0412555 C3525387 C0947630 C0015801 C1280173 C0226448 C1281581 C0226455 C0015809 C0027551 C0007431 C0398266 C0398296 C1185740 C0441587 C0441587 C0035139 C1555588 C1515974 C0027551 C0007431 C0398266 C0398296 C0003842 C1142191 C0202951 C1690943 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0441587 C0035139 C0085590 C1704454 C1546572 C0231519 C0240795 C0556030 C0681324 C2347268 C0005893 C1305855 C0231255 C0231254 C0392148 C0179038 C3887804 C0085096 C0553983 C0162819 C0199686 C0011871 C3698278 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0189897 C0843851 C0018795 C0189896 C0002978 C1536105 C1690968 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0489868 C0190961 C0015811 C0009797 C0041618 C2368378 C0412555 C3525387 C0086960 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0080194 C1705273 C2827501 C0243161 C0015801 C1280173 C0226448 C1281581 C0226455 C3245511 C2228442 C0201975 C1561535 C0302272 C0011946 C1654851 C0549206 C0009797 C1299582 C0018795 C0261588 C2007122 C2008028 C2024151 C2183227 C1542709 C2023616 C2023644 C2023645 C2023814 C0179700 C2023568 C0801759 C2008021 C0520886 C2121436 C2216125 C2216126 C2216128 C2216129 C2216130 C2216131 C2216132 C2216133 C2061879 C2061880 C2061881 C2061882 C2216122 C2216123 C2216124 C2216127 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0948089 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727 C2348362 C1168331 C0455406 C0340324 C1998297 C0340312 C0340325 C0428950 C2825159 C0443343 C0179912 C0542294 ", "concepts": "ultrasounds, ultrasound, OB Ultrasound, Arterial, Femoral, Triall summary, summary vascular ultrasound, Intravascular ultrasound, Ocular ultrasound, study, Evaluate CCA -
