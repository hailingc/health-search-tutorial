{"text": "TITLE:\n      Clinical and Economical Interest of Endovascular Cooling in the Management of Cardiac Arrest (ICEREA Study)\nSUMMARY:\n      According to international guidelines, mild therapeutic hypothermia is recommended for\n      resuscitated patients after cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. Whether external\n      or internal cooling is superior in terms of prognosis or security remains unknown. The aim\n      of this study is to evaluate in a randomized trial the clinical and economical interests of\n      the endovascular cooling versus the conventional external cooling for the management of\n      hypothermia after cardiac arrest.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      According to international guidelines, mild therapeutic hypothermia is recommended for\n      resuscitated patients after experiencing cardiac arrest from cardiac origin: \"unconscious\n      adult patients with spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest should be cooled to 32-34\u00b0C\n      for 12-24 hours when the initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation\" or pulseless\n      ventricular tachycardia. \"Such cooling may also be beneficial for other rhythm or\n      in-hospital cardiac arrest\".\n      \"External or internal cooling techniques can be used to initiate cooling within minutes to\n      hours\". The two main randomized and positive studies dealing with the efficiency of\n      hypothermia after cardiac arrest have used external cooling systems. However, several animal\n      studies documented the importance of initiating hypothermia as soon as possible after\n      cardiac arrest. Intravascular cooling enables more rapid induction of hypothermia compared\n      with external cooling method after brain injury. Although several human studies have also\n      documented that intravascular cooling provides more precise control of core temperature than\n      external methods and although an endovascular method has been used safely in pilot studies\n      in those experiencing hypothermia after cardiac arrest, the superiority of such a cooling on\n      the prognosis after cardiac arrest remains unknown, as well as its cost efficiency.\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate in a randomized trial the potential clinical and\n      economical interests of the endovascular cooling versus the conventional external cooling\n      for the management of cardiac arrest from cardiac origin. With a clinical primary endpoint\n      (survival without major neurological sequels), this study will also focus on important\n      secondary endpoints, as the burden of nurse work and the economical costs induced by these 2\n      different methods of cooling.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -
