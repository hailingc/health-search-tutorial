{"text": "TITLE:\n      Analgesic Efficacy of Morphine Alone or Combined With Paracetamol and/or Ibuprofen for Long-bones Fractures in Children\nSUMMARY:\n      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two drugs: paracetamol and\n      ibuprofen in association with morphine, compared with morphine alone on analgesia in\n      children seen in the emergency department for a long-bone fracture and also to study the\n      potential synergic effect of the association paracetamol and ibuprofen.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Long-bone fractures are a very common complain for visits in paediatric emergency\n      departments. Since these fractures are often very painful, morphine is considered the\n      cornerstone treatment in case of severe pain. Very few data are available concerning the\n      assessment of analgesic treatment in this condition. In our previous study, less than 50% of\n      patients with a limb fracture had a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) \u2264 30 mm after morphine\n      administration. Thus, one study make the hypothesis that the use of a combination of\n      morphine and/or paracetamol and/or NSAID could be an effective and safe option for the\n      treatment of pain due to long bone fractures. We undertake to compare different combinations\n      of paracetamol and ibuprofen with morphine to determine the efficacy and safety of these\n      strategies in emergency department paediatric patients with acute traumatic limb pain.\n      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two drugs: paracetamol and\n      ibuprofen in association with morphine, compared with morphine alone on analgesia in\n      children seen in the emergency department for a long-bone fracture and also to study the\n      potential synergic effect of the association paracetamol and ibuprofen.\n      Second objectives are\n        -  to compare the long term analgesic efficacy of 4 analgesic regimens\n           a)ibuprofen/morphine, b)paracetamol/morphine, c)ibuprofen/paracetamol/morphine and\n           d)morphine for long bone fracture management in the paediatric emergency department.\n        -  To assess the tolerance of these 4 regimens.\n      The study is considered as a success if children 2-6 years (6 years included) have a pain\n      score Evendol < 5 and children 7-17 years (17 years included) have a pain score assessed by\n      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) \u2264 30 without additional analgesic treatment 30 minutes after drug\n      administration.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  children aged 2 through 17 years (17 years included) accompanied by at least one of\n             their parents in the emergency department\n          -  accompanied by at least one of their parents in the emergency department\n          -  suspected fracture of a long bone requiring morphine analgesia (VAS \u2265 60/100 or\n             Evendol \u2265 7/15 at the inclusion)\n          -  within the first 12 hours after the injury\n          -  at least one signed parental informed consent\n          -  affiliated to health insurance\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  analgesic treatment within the 6 hours before inclusion\n          -  contraindication to one of the study drug\n          -  cognitive impairment\n          -  multiple injuries\n          -  resuscitation man\u0153uvres\n          -  open fracture\n          -  non affiliated to social security\n          -  parental refusal\n", "cuis": "C0000970 C0373527 C0002771 C0728960 C0015838 C0002766 C0344307 C1660219 C3202977
