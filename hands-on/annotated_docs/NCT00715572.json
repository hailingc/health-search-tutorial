{"text": "TITLE:\n      Combined Therapy With L-Thyroxine and L-Triiodothyronine Compared to L-Thyroxine Alone\nSUMMARY:\n      The objective of this study was to analyze the features of monotherapy with L-T4 in\n      comparison with combined therapy with L-T4 and L-T3 in patients with primary hypothyroidism.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      We conducted a randomized controlled study with a crossover design in 36 premenopausal women\n      with overt primary hypothyroidism (reduced T4 concentration accompanied by increased TSH\n      concentration at the time of initial diagnosis) who did not receive thyroid hormones. All\n      patients were divided into two groups: patients from Group A (n=20) were randomized to L-T4\n      in dose of 1,6 \u03bcg per kg, followed by combined L-T4 and L-T3; and 16 women from Group B\n      received the combination of L-T4+L-T3 (the dose of L-T4 was reduced by 25 \u03bcg and replaced\n      with 12,5 \u03bcg of L-T3), followed by monotherapy with L-T4. The treatment periods lasted for 6\n      months. Patients were examined at baseline and at the end of each treatment period.Blood\n      samples were obtained to measure serum TSH, free T4, free T3, lipid profile, osteocalcin.\n      Urine samples were collected to measure urinary deoxypyridinoline / creatinine ratio.\n      24-hour ECG-monitoring, osteodensitometry and psychological testing were also performed at\n      baseline and at the end of each treatment period.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Premenopausal women with overt primary hypothyroidism (reduced T4 concentration\n             accompanied by increased TSH concentration at the time of initial diagnosis) who did\n             not receive thyroid hormones\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Peri- and postmenopause\n          -  Pregnancy\n          -  Major comorbidity\n          -  Use of drugs that affect metabolism or bioavailability of thyroid hormones\n             preparations.\n", "cuis": "C0041014 C2936843 C0428419 C3853639 C0041017 C0040165 C1881373 C0011824 C2936885 C0202231 C1281902 C0087111 C1363945 C1510538 C0439044 C1552616 C1706244 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0947630 C0179038 C0700502 C0033972 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C1096235 C0206158 C0993589 C0025320 C0947630 C0282440 C0700502 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C0586553 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0040132 C0040134 C2228489 C0076638 C0117002 C1552839 C0427621 C0427622 C0427624 C0302044 C0302046 C0348801 C3539181 C3539182 C3539954 C3539955 C3539956 C3539957 C3539959 C3539960 C3539961 C3539962 C3539963 C3539964 C3539965 C3539966 C3539967 C3539968 C3539969 C3539970 C3539971 C3539972 C3539973 C3539974 C3539975 C3539976 C3539977 C3539978 C3539979 C3540026 C3540027 C3540028 C3540030 C3540031 C3540719 C3540720 C3540721 C3540722 C3540723 C3540724 C3540740 C3854036 C3811910 C0052142 C0251244 C0965970 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0025344 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0332128 C0000589 C0025638 C0025344 C0229664 C0851353 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1561542 C0728774 C0373691 C1277938 C0202225 C0519160 C0523744 C0042036 C1547942 C1610733 C2963137 C0523601 C0201975 C1561535 C0033905 C0027902 C0150369 C1283169 C0026426 C0182230 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0025344 C0728774 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0700502 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C1096235 C0206158 C0025320 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0586553 C0040132 C0040134 C2228489 C0076638 C0117002 C0243161 C0206159 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0220880 C0025519 C3822292 C0040132 C0040134 C2228489 C0076638 C0117002 C0001721 C2237113 C0013227 C1947944 C2010602 C0071888 C3887664 ", "concepts": "Triiodothyronine, l-Triiodothyronine, Triiodothyronine, Triiodothyronine T3, 3,3,5-Triiodothyronine, Thyroxine, L-Thyroxine, D-Thyroxine, l-Thyroxine, Thyroxine, Thyroxine, Therapy, Therapy, E-Therapy, Alone summary, summary Objective, objective, Objective, study, analyzer primary hypothyroidism, combined therapy description, prescription, prescription premenopausal, premenopause, premenopause, menopausal, study, randomized controlled trial primary hypothyroidism, concentrations, Concentration, Hemoconcentration, Hemoconcentration, Increased TSH concentrations, Concentration, Hemoconcentration, Hemoconcentration, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, thyroids, thyroid, thyroid, thyroidin, Euthyroid groups, Group A1, Group A2, Group AB, Group A1B, Group A3B Group B combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, Combination, AP combination, MP combination, ET combination Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, periods Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, Examined, Mexamine, Hexamine, period, Blood, Blood, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, month, Vaseline osteocalcin, serum TSH, free T4, free T3, lipids Urine, Urine, Urine, Urine, Deoxypyridinoline, Creatinine, Creatinine psychological testing, neuropsychological testing, monitoring, Monitoring, monitoring BP, monitoring ph Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, period, Vaseline criteria, Eligibility Criteria primary hypothyroidism, concentrations, Concentration, Hemoconcentration, Hemoconcentration, premenopausal, Premenopause, menopausal concentrations, Concentration, Hemoconcentration, Hemoconcentration, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, Increased TSH thyroids, thyroid, thyroid, thyroidin, Euthyroid Criteria postmenopause pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
