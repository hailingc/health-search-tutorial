{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effect of a Meal Replacement on Weight Loss Obesity Patients With Metabolic Syndrome\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to determine whether meal replacement, SlimWell \u00ae, is effective\n      in the treatment of obesity patients with metabolic syndrome.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The participants are divided into two groups: intervention group and control group. In the\n      intervention group, the participants receive a meal replacement plus life style\n      modification. In the control group, the participants receive only life style modification.\n      Sample size calculation is 69 participants per group. Primary outcome is to compare the\n      weight loss between the intervention group and control group.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Body mass index more than or equal to 25 kg/m2\n          -  Patients with metabolic syndrome\n          -  Patients who are on anti-hypertensive drugs, oral hypoglycemic drugs and lipid\n             lowering drugs.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Uncontrolled diabetes patients\n          -  Patients with gastrointestinal abnormalities\n          -  Patients with cardiovascular diseases\n          -  Patients with hematologic disorders\n          -  Patients with Glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/min/1.73m2\n          -  Patients with drug or alcohol abuse\n          -  Pregnancy and lactation\n", "cuis": "C0524620 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C1262477 C0028754 C1963185 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C0947630 C0524620 C1262289 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0028754 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1552839 C0596948 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C1552839 C0183663 C3840684 C1552839 C0183663 C0439631 C3845732 C1552839 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1262477 C0424641 C2911645 C0041667 C3665346 C1552839 C0596948 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0005893 C1305855 C0231255 C0231254 C2724372 C0524620 C1262289 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0003364 C0020616 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0523744 C0013227 C1820370 C0243161 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0857250 C2707256 C0596601 C0809794 C0017173 C0184122 C0687713 C0920703 C0017181 C0017185 C0203054 C0237938 C0436865 C0744333 C0849766 C1141929 C2697368 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C3809765 C0015393 C0151583 C0151611 C0476403 C0522214 C1832603 C2183966 C2674738 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0042373 C0558373 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0018939 C0037274 C1263982 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0017654 C1561549 C0853068 C0853069 C1559911 C1559912 C1559913 C1559914 C1559915 C0854050 C0856948 C1507366 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0085762 C0013227 C1254351 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0043084 C0006147 ", "concepts": "Metabolic Syndrome, replacement, Replacement, placement, Weight Loss, Obesity, Obesity, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary replacements, Replacement, placement, study Dysmetabolic syndrome x, Dysmetabolic syndrome, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, obesity description, prescription, prescription interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, groups, mind control interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, replacements, Replacement, placement, groups, stylet Modification, groups, stylet Primary, Miscalculation, groups interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, Weight loss, height loss, Weight loss, weight low, sight loss, groups, mind control criteria, Eligibility Criteria body mass index, Body mass index, NOS, Body mass index low, Body mass index high, Body mass index docd Dysmetabolic syndrome x, Dysmetabolic syndrome, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient anti-hypertensive drugs, hypoglycemic drugs, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, lipids drugs, flowering Criteria Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes, Uncontrolled INR Gastrointestinal, gastrointestinal gas, gastrointestines, gastrointestinal agent, gastrointestinal tubes, gastrointestinal pains, gastrointestinal sign, gastrointestinal bleed, gastrointestinal tumor, X-ray gastrointestinal, Ulcer gastrointestinal, O/E -
