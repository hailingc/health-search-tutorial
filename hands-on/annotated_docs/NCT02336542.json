{"text": "TITLE:\n      Phase IIb Clinical Study of Recombinant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Allergen ESAT6-CFP10\nSUMMARY:\n      96 TB subjects and 96 non-TB subjects with lung disease who all meet the standard are\n      divided into different groups through a randomized, blind methods.Every subject inject\n      intradermally ESAT6-CFP10 and TB-PPD in different arms of the same person.Specific \u03b3-\n      IFN(gamma interferon) detection is needed before the injection.Evaluate the sensitivity\n      (positive coincidence rate) ,the specificity (negative coincidence rate) and the coincidence\n      rate of ESAT6-CFP10 in the tuberculosis patients and non-tuberculosis patients with lung\n      diseases, and determine the optimal dose of ESAT6-CFP10 for clinical auxiliary diagnosis of\n      tuberculosis.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Firstly,96 TB(Tuberculosis ) subjects which meet the standard respectively are divided into\n      different groups through a randomized, blind methods.\n        1. ESAT6-CFP10 \uff085\u03bcg/ml\uff09in left arm\uff1b\n        2. ESAT6-CFP10 \uff085\u03bcg/ml\uff09in right arm\uff1b\n        3. ESAT6-CFP10 \uff0810\u03bcg/ml\uff09in left arm\uff1b\n        4. ESAT6-CFP10 \uff0810\u03bcg/ml\uff09in right arm\uff1b Inject intradermally ESAT6-CFP10 and\n           TB-PPD(tuberculin purified protein derivative ) in different arms of the same\n           subject.For each of the participants in this clinical research, this study uniform that\n           left arm inject a drug(ESAT6-CFP10 or TB - PPD) first, observe 30 min and no no obvious\n           adverse reaction ,then another drug(ESAT6-CFP10 or TB - PPD) inject in right arm. We\n           need draw blood to detect specific \u03b3- IFN before the injection.Observe and record the\n           vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood pressure and temperature),the skin reaction\n           diameter of injection site (flush and induration) , local reactions (rash, pain,\n           itching and skin mucous membrane) and a variety of adverse events.\n      Secondly, 96 non-TB subjects with lung disease are divided into different groups and the\n      procedure are as the same as 96 TB subjects above .\n      Finally,we evaluate the sensitivity (positive coincidence rate) ,the specificity (negative\n      coincidence rate) and the coincidence rate of ESAT6-CFP10 in the TB patients and\n      non-tuberculosis patients with lung diseases,determine the optimal dose of ESAT6-CFP10 for\n      clinical auxiliary diagnosis of tuberculosis,and further evaluate the safety of ESAT6-CFP10\n      for the clinical auxiliary diagnosis of tuberculosis .\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria of TB (tuberculosis ) subjects:\n          -  Diagnosis TB ;\n          -  18 to 65 years ;\n          -  Consent and signed informed consent forms(ICF) ;\n
