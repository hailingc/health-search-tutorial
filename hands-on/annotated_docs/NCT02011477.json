{"text": "TITLE:\n      Hypoalgesic Effects Neural Mobilization Techniques\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immediate mechanical hypoalgesic effect of\n      neural mobilization in asymptomatic subjects. We also compared neural gliding versus neural\n      stretching to see which produced greater hypoalgesic effects in asymptomatic subjects.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Asymptomatic subjects will be randomly allocated into three groups: the neural glide group;\n      the neural stretch group; and the placebo group. Each subject will receive one treatment\n      session. Outcome measures included bilateral pressure pain threshold measured at the\n      trigeminal, cervical, and tibialis anterior points, which will assess pre-treatment and\n      immediately post-treatment by a blinded assessor. Three-way repeated measures analysis of\n      variance was used to evaluate changes in pressure pain threshold, with group (experimental\n      or control) as the between-subjects variable and time (pre-, post-treatment) or side\n      (dominant, nondominant) as the within-subjects variable.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Asymptomatic subjects who met the inclusion criterion of being between 18 and 30\n             years old.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  rheumatologic diseases or any type of cancer, cervical surgery in the past, whiplash\n             trauma and undergoing any type of treatment like physical therapy, manual therapy,\n             osteopathy, chiropraxis, acupuncture during the last three months. All patients\n             recruited for the study complained of pain localized in the neck and/or head region.\n             Initial screening was accomplished by telephone and eligible persons attended a\n             evaluation appointment.\n          -  development of systemic or degenerative diseases\n          -  subjects with symptoms of depression according Beck's questionnaire\n          -  pain in any area between the lower back and head in the last 9 months\n          -  traumatic event in the past 12 months\n          -  history of neck or face pain in the last 6 months\n", "cuis": "C0185112 C2080791 C0085625 C0025664 C1552616 C1706244 C1697779 C0947630 C0085625 C0699886 C0220825 C0185112 C2080791 C0020944 C4048292 C0185113 C0231221 C0343751 C0231221 C0343751 C0600080 C0232602 C0085625 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0231221 C1552839 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0600080 C0150789 C0270814 C0032042 C1552839 C0162703 C0423725 C0423727 C0460139 C0233697 C0242690 C1305065 C0815873 C0229861 C0815872 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0027530 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1697779 C0002778 C0162703 C0423725 C0423727 C0460139 C1552839 C0220825 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0231221 C0243161 C0243161 C2044988 C0742216 C0012634 C0043145 C0006826 C0260515 C0029709 C0949766 C0553651 C0204093 C1948126 C2064714 C2148126 C0454525 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C3263723 C3714660 C0394664 C0005940 C0419203 C1561542 C0520962 C0947630 C0027530 C2137077 C0018670 C0152336 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C1576871 C1626258 C3273808 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0870427 C0011164 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0012634 C0086132 C0034394 C1706422 C0815327 C0030193 C0018670 C0152336 C1561542 C1561542 C0015468 C1962975 C0262926 C2004062 C0027530 C2137077 C1561542 ", "concepts": "mobilizations, mobilization, Hypoalgesia, techniques summary, summary immediate, study, hypoalgesia, Mechanical, Evaluate mobilizations, mobilization, immobilization, Immobilization, Remobilization, asymptomatic, asymptomatic HIV asymptomatic, asymptomatic HIV, stretching, retching, hypoalgesia description, prescription, prescription Asymptomatic, groups Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, stretch, stretcher, stretches, placebo, groups pain threshold, Low pain threshold, High pain threshold, pressure, Obsession M. tibialis anterior, Tibialis anterior, Left tibialis anterior, Nodus tibialis anterior, Right tibialis anterior, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, Cervical Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, immediate, Analysis pain threshold, Low pain threshold, High pain threshold, pressure, groups, Evaluate Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment criteria, Eligibility Criteria Asymptomatic, criterion Criteria cervical surgery (GYN), cervical spine surgery, diseases, whiplash, cancers, cancer physical; therapy, physical therapies, Other physical therapy, other physical therapy, physical therapy care, chest physical therapy, physical therapy goals, manual therapy, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, trauma, trauma acupuncture, Osteopathy, Osteopathy, month pain localized, study, neck, neck, head, head screening, Screening, screening, screening, Screening, Telephone, Telephone, Telephone Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, disappointment degenerative, development, Development, Development, Development, No development, diseases symptoms of depression, questionnaire, Questionnaires, NET questionnaire pain, head, head, month month of face pain, Face pain, history, history, neck, neck, month "}
