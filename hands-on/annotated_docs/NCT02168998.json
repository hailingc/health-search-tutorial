{"text": "TITLE:\n      Cortisol Measurement During Intravenous Access With a Medical Clown\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the presence of a medical clown in a\n      pediatric emergency department procedure room would reduce children's anxiety. The\n      investigators hypothesize that this positive influence will be expressed as lower levels of\n      the stress hormone (Cortisol) in the blood.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients needing venous blood sampling or insertion of an intravenous canula\n          -  Normal development according to parents\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Critically ill children (e.g. shock, respiratory distress or failure)\n          -  Children whose blood work or intravenous canula must be obtained rapidly for\n             therapeutic reasons (e.g. antibiotic administration in a patient with severe\n             bacterial infections)\n          -  Known adrenal or pituitary disease\n          -  Children who have received glucocorticoids during the preceeding six weeks\n", "cuis": "C0201968 C0236401 C0199168 C1561579 C0085297 C1552616 C1706244 C0392148 C0947630 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0003467 C0860603 C0876889 C0220644 C0220645 C1514241 C0020268 C0201968 C0038435 C0005768 C0229664 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0190979 C0444255 C0441587 C0035139 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1821244 C0243161 C0476273 C0035220 C0436692 C0748355 C0877339 C0010340 C0036974 C0005768 C0229664 C0199779 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C1306232 C0004623 C0026918 C0162627 C0729527 C0521833 C2939130 C0015404 C0949113 C0340669 C0032002 C0521428 C3540777 C3540778 ", "concepts": "Cortisol Measurement, Free Cortisol Measurement, Medical, Medical, Intravenous IG summary, summary presence, study emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure, anxiety, anxiety, Pediatric, pediatric HD, pediatric st Positive cortisol, Cortisol, stress, blood, blood criteria, Eligibility Criteria venous blood sampling, venous blood sample, insertion, Reinsertion, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient Normal development Criteria respiratory distress, Respiratory distress syn, O/E - respiratory distress, Acute respiratory distress, Cardio-respiratory distress, Critically ill, shock blood, blood antibiotic administration, Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic, severed other bacterial infection, Mycobacterial infection, bacterial infection skin, oral bacterial infection, bacterial ear infections, Other bacterial infections, ocular bacterial infections, Bacterial infections NEC, Arterial infection pituitary disease, adrenal Glucocorticoids, Glucocorticoids "}
