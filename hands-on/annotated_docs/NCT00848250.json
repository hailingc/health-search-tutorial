{"text": "TITLE:\n      Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors During Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Infants and Children\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ACE inhibitors alter the fibrinolytic,\n      inflammatory, and hemodynamic response to cardiopulmonary bypass in infants and children\n      with congenital heart disease.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Infants or children (newborn to 17 years of age) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass\n             for elective surgical correction of a congenital heart defect.\n          -  Patients must be taking an ACE inhibitor prior to their operation\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients in which discontinuing ACEIs is deemed unsafe by their primary cardiologist\n          -  Any condition rendering the subjects legal guardian unable to understand the nature,\n             scope, and possible consequences of the study.\n          -  Pregnancy as ruled out by standard of care screening procedures.\n          -  Individuals whose weight is less than 3.5 kg at the time of enrollment.\n          -  Inability to comply with the protocol. ie. Children in whom it is deemed unsafe to\n             have the extra blood draws, and children who are thought to be noncompliant with\n             their medications.\n", "cuis": "C0003015 C3536837 C0919881 C0201888 C0007202 C0018830 C1552616 C1706244 C0003015 C0040044 C0003304 C0947630 C0441229 C0007202 C0429123 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0442743 C0003209 C0152021 C0455683 C0265808 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0007202 C0429123 C1551035 C2239178 C3843406 C0018787 C1546398 C1546846 C0543467 C0587668 C0003015 C0543467 C3244306 C0035110 C0949626 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0243161 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0162340 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C1299582 C3539129 C0947630 C0220908 C2936643 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C3888021 C1516879 C0424653 C1305866 C2053618 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0190979 C2355654 C0005834 C0376405 C1101725 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 ", "concepts": "Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor [EPC], Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Fetopathy, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, Cardiopulmonary Bypass, Cardiopulmonary Bypass Units summary, summary ACE inhibitors, fibrinolytic, antifibrinolytic, study, Halter CPB - Cardiopulmonary bypass, Cardiopulmonary bypass time, Response, Response, Response, Noninflammatory, Antiinflammatory CHD - Congenital heart disease, FH: Congenital heart disease, Cyanotic congenital heart disease criteria, Eligibility Criteria CPB - Cardiopulmonary bypass, Cardiopulmonary bypass time, newborn, newborn, 13-17 years of age heart, Elective, Elective, Surgical, Surgical ACE inhibitor, operation, operations, reoperation, Reoperation, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient Criteria Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient understand, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, unable, Legal guardian study screening procedures, standard of care, pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
