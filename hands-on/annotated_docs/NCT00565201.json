{"text": "TITLE:\n      Evaluation of BOTOX\u00ae With Rehabilitation Therapy for the Treatment of Wrist and Hand Spasticity in Post-Stroke Patients\nSUMMARY:\n      The present study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of injections of\n      BOTOX\u00ae in spastic muscles of the arm and hand compared with injections of saline (which\n      would do nothing) when combined with rehabilitation therapy for the improvement of active\n      function tasks in post-stroke patients. Injections will be targeted to reduce common\n      spasticity patterns of the arm and hand which include: bent elbow, palm down forearm, bent\n      wrist, thumb-in-palm, clenched fist, and other hand deformities. This will be done only at\n      Emory University. Neither the doctor injecting the drug nor the subject receiving the drug\n      will know if they are getting BOTOX\u00ae or saline. Which type of injection the subject receives\n      will be completely randomized (like flipping a coin). All subjects will have rehabilitation\n      therapy after their injections. Subjects will be assessed at a total of 5 scheduled visits\n      (qualification (Week 1), Injection (Week 2), Evaluations on Weeks 8, 10, and 14. All\n      subjects will receive rehabilitation therapy immediately after their injections for 1 hour a\n      day, 3-5 times a week, for 4 weeks. The results from this project will provide valuable data\n      on the ability of BOTOX\u00ae and physical rehabilitation to provide effective treatment to\n      spastic muscles of the arm and hand after stroke. This project has the potential to increase\n      the availability of effective rehabilitation techniques to patients with stroke.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      After a stroke, patients commonly experience tightness in their affected arm from wrist and\n      hand muscle overactivity called spasticity. Spasticity is difficult to manage with only one\n      type of treatment. Usual treatments of spasticity are not very effective and may produce\n      unwanted side effects. Untreated spasticity may result in muscular problems and decrease a\n      patient's general ability to function and thus affect his/her quality of life.\n      BOTOX\u00ae, a botulinum toxin type A produced from Clostridium botulinum, blocks certain\n      chemicals that cause spasticity. With appropriate injections of BOTOX\u00ae in the correct\n      muscle, it can change the tightness in the muscle temporarily. Published reports indicate\n      that several hundred adult patients with arm and/or leg spasticity of various causes (e.g.,\n      poststroke, multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury) have benefited from injections of\n      BOTOX\u00ae in the spastic muscle. The efficacy of BOTOX\u00ae in patients with post-stroke spasticity\n      in their arms and hands has been demonstrated in seven phase 2 placebo-controlled studies\n      and two phase 3 studies.\n      The present study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of injections of\n      BOTOX\u00ae in spastic muscles of the arm and hand compared with injections of saline (which\n      would do nothing) when combined with rehabilitation therapy for the improvement of active\n      function tasks in post-stroke patients. Injections will be targeted to reduce common\n      spasticity patterns of the arm and hand which include: bent elbow, palm down forearm, bent\n      wrist, thumb-in-palm, clenched fist, and other hand deformities. This will be done only at\n      Emory University. Neither the doctor injecting the drug nor the subject receiving the drug\n      will know if they are getting BOTOX\u00ae or saline. Which type of injection the subject receives\n      will be completely randomized (like flipping a coin). All subjects will have rehabilitation\n      therapy after their injections. Subjects will be assessed at a total of 5 scheduled visits\n      (qualification (Week 1), Injection (Week 2), Evaluations on Weeks 8, 10, and 14. All\n      subjects will receive rehabilitation therapy immediately after their injections for 1 hour a\n      day, 3-5 times a week, for 4 weeks. The results from this project will provide valuable data\n      on the ability of BOTOX\u00ae and physical rehabilitation to provide effective treatment to\n      spastic muscles of the arm and hand after stroke.
