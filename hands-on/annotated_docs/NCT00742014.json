{"text": "TITLE:\n      The Assessment of Right Ventricular Contractility in Response to Sildenafil\nSUMMARY:\n      The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of Sildenafil, administered\n      during cardiac catheterization, on right ventricular contractility in children with\n      pulmonary arterial hypertension.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The effectiveness of Sildenafil as a pulmonary vasodilator in children with heart disease\n      was first reported in detail during cardiac catheterization and postoperatively in 2003. It\n      is now used frequently for long-term treatment of children with pulmonary arterial\n      hypertension at The Hospital for Sick Children and it is now a routine part of the\n      hospital's testing protocol for all patients being evaluated for pulmonary hypertension in\n      the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n      The beneficial effects of Sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension are thought to result\n      predominantly from relative vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects on the pulmonary\n      vasculature. On the basis of early data showing lack of significant PDE5 expression in the\n      normal heart, PDE5 was thought to be expressed in the coronary vessels but not in the human\n      myocardium. Very recently, it was reported for the first time that PDE5 is markedly\n      upregulated in hypertrophied right ventricular myocardium in humans and that in the rat PDE5\n      inhibition with Sildenafil increases contractility in hypertrophied right ventricular\n      myocardium but not in normal right ventricle, which lacks PDE5 expression. The assessment of\n      right ventricular contractility in humans is a challenge, but we have developed several\n      techniques that are recognized as 'state of the art' assessment of right ventricular\n      function.\n      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of Sildenafil, which is routinely\n      administered during cardiac catheterization to assess pulmonary vascular resistance, on\n      right ventricular contractility in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Significant pulmonary arterial hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure > 25 mm\n             Hg)\n          -  Patients aged 4-18 years\n          -  Routine cardiac catheterization clinically indicated for deciding therapeutic\n             treatment\n          -  Informed assent/consent from patient/parent\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Suprasystemic pulmonary artery pressures\n          -  Evidence of right heart failure\n          -  History of ventricular arrhythmia\n          -  Known vascular access arrhythmia\n          -  Contraindication to Sildenafil\n          -  Concurrent inotropic / PDE administration\n          -  Other medical, psychological or social circumstances which complicate a regular\n             participation in the study, and/or increase the risk for the patients themselves\n          -  No consent/assent\n          -  Pregnancy or unwillingness to comply with contraceptive advice\n", "cuis": "C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1261322 C2826217 C0529793 C1957881 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0018827 C1552616 C1706244 C0529793 C1957881 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0947630 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0018795 C0261588 C2007122 C2008028 C2024151 C2183227 C1542709 C2023616 C2023644 C2023645 C2023814 C0179700 C2023568 C0801759 C2008021 C0018827 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0020538 C0264648 C0020649 C0024109 C2707265 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0018799 C2186266 C0042402 C3537240 C0529793 C1957881 C0024109 C2707265 C0018795 C0261588 C2007122 C2008028 C2024151 C2183227 C1542709 C2023616 C2023644 C2023645 C2023814 C0179700 C2023568 C0801759 C2008021 C0700287 C1549114 C0684224 C0023977 C0024109 C2707265 C0003842 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0221423 C0020542 C1963220 C1868851 C0152171 C3203102 C3807623 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C0220825 C0018795 C0261588 C2007122 C2008028 C2024151 C2183227 C1542709 C2023616 C2023644 C2023645 C2023814 C0179700 C2023568 C0801759 C2008021 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C0020542 C1963220 C1868851 C0152171 C3203102 C3807623 C0529793 C1957881 C3869883 C0024109 C2707265 C0042402 C3537240 C0334094 C3172260 C0005839 C0185117 C3245479 C0010075 C1456016 C2349205 C0700287 C1549114 C0684224 C0020564 C0018827 C2097385 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0020564 C0018827 C0021467 C0424296 C0529793 C1957881 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0225883 C1269891 C0185117 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C1553386 C0018827 C0805586 C2347900 C2348080 C0798503 C2363670 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0018827 C0025664 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0031843 C1705273 C0529793 C1957881 C0947630 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0456261 C2023641 C2023634 C0488644 C3887538 C1867423 C0018795 C0261588 C2007122 C2008028 C2024151 C2183227 C1542709 C2023616 C2023644 C2023645 C2023814 C0179700 C2023568 C0801759 C2008021 C0020538 C0264648 C0020649 C0018827 C0024109 C2707265 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0428642 C2008312 C1168098 C0034094 C3805917 C0020538 C0264648 C0020649 C0024109 C2707265 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0018795 C0261588 C2007122 C2008028 C2024151 C2183227 C1542709 C2023616 C2023644 C2023645 C2023814 C0179700 C2023568 C0801759 C2008021 C1547582 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C1444656 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0243161 C0428642 C2008312 C1168098 C0034094 C3805917 C4050047 C4071553 C0235527 C2939447 C0264715 C0085612 C1883529 C0344424 C0428974 C1963277 C0344427 C0262926 C2004062 C0750138 C0042371 C0280956 C0003811 C0861148 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C0529793 C1957881 C1533734 C0376495 C0199808 C0199810 C0725057 C1536282 C0001563 C0036589 C0150270 C3469597 C3841442 C1306597 C0848372 C0580097 C0947630 C0009871 C0344225 C0009886 C0877698 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0150600 C0740209 ", "concepts": "assessment, Assessment, Assessment, assessment, No Assessment, Sildenafil, aildenafil, response, Response, Response, ventricular summary, summary Sildenafil, aildenafil, Objective, objective, Objective, study, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined CCA -
