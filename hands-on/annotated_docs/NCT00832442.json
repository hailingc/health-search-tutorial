{"text": "TITLE:\n      Collaborative Systematic Overview of Randomised Controlled Trials of Beta-Blockers in the Treatment of Heart Failure\nSUMMARY:\n      Several large trials have shown that beta-blocker treatment reduces the risk of death and\n      hospital admission in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Unfortunately, survey data\n      suggests relatively poor utilisation of beta-blockers, despite ample evidence for good\n      tolerability. Additionally there are several important unanswered questions, such as\n      clinical efficacy for specific sub-populations (women, the elderly and patients with\n      diabetes or other co-morbidities) and the effect of beta-blockers in combination with other\n      medications. Previous meta-analyses, based on published tabular data, have been conducted\n      although this approach has important biases and limitations.\n      We plan to perform a carefully conducted systematic review of individual patient data from\n      the major randomised trials of beta-blockers in heart failure. The goals of this\n      collaborative project are to clarify the overall efficacy of beta-blockers and identify\n      sub-groups that show particular benefit, thereby increasing the use of beta-blockers,\n      reducing adverse clinical outcomes and the high costs associated with this condition.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Randomised control trials of beta-blocker versus control in patients with documented\n             heart failure\n          -  Unconfounded trials only (in which one treatment group differed from another only by\n             the beta-blocker therapy of interest)\n          -  Randomization process precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment (for example\n             trials in which treatment allocation was alternate or based on odd or even dates\n             would not be included)\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Trial sample size of less than 300 patients\n", "cuis": "C0001645 C0018801 C0018802 C2911690 C0180112 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0814812 C1552616 C1706244 C0001645 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0011065 C1306577 C0184666 C3696800 C0488547 C0489545 C0600290 C0018801 C0018802 C0038951 C3245479 C0231221 C0001645 C0508431 C1552740 C3272565 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0001645 C3539181 C3539182 C3539954 C3539955 C3539956 C3539957 C3539959 C3539960 C3539961 C3539962 C3539963 C3539964 C3539965 C3539966 C3539967 C3539968 C3539969 C3539970 C3539971 C3539972 C3539973 C3539974 C3539975 C3539976 C3539977 C3539978 C3539979 C3540026 C3540027 C3540028 C3540030 C3540031 C3540719 C3540720 C3540721 C3540722 C3540723 C3540724 C3540740 C3854036 C3811910 C0052142 C0251244 C0965970 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 C3245479 C1704324 C0179038 C1955832 C3245479 C0021228 C0018801 C0018802 C0018017 C0679840 C0001645 C0001645 C3858576 C2065082 C1552839 C0001645 C0221106 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C3272565 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0001645 C1301725 C1609436 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C0018801 C0018802 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1552839 C0001645 C0543488 C0087111 C0033972 C0376554 C4036285 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1509223 C1555588 C0243161 C0441621 C1966209 ", "concepts": "Beta-Blockers, Heart Failure, Heart Failure, Controlled, Controller, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, overview summary, summary beta-blocker, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, deaths, death hospital admission, 3 at hospital admission, Hospital admission Dx, Hospital admission Dx, hospital readmission, heart failures, Heart failure, survey, data, Asymptomatic beta-blocker answered questions specific, Clinical Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes, beta-blocker, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, Combination, AP combination, MP combination, ET combination medications, medications:, Medications, Medications, medication:, Premedications, data, Published, analyser systematic review, data, individuality heart failures, Heart failure, goals, goals, beta-blocker beta-blocker, deidentify, coveralls groups, beta-blocker, increasing ph condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, Clinical criteria, Eligibility Criteria beta-blocker, Documented, Documented, document, document, document heart failures, Heart failure Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, groups beta-blocker, interest, therapy, Cotherapy knowledge, No knowledge, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, dates, location Criteria sampled, Triall "}
