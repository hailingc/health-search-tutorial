{"text": "TITLE:\n      Immune Response After Booster Vaccination in HIV - Infected Patients Who Received Rabies Primary Vaccination\nSUMMARY:\n      Booster rabies vaccination in HIV - infected patients who have ever received rabies primary\n      vaccination could improve their immune response to this kind of vaccine.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The investigators have learned from the previous studies that some HIV-infected patients\n      especially those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count had poor antibody response to rabies\n      vaccination. Because of the role of the memory B cell, the investigators hypothesized that\n      primary rabies immunization in HIV-infected patients could rise rapid anamnestic antibody\n      response to ones after booster vaccination in case of re-exposure of rabies occur despite of\n      their immunocompromised state.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  HIV infected patients 18-60 years of age\n          -  Ever received primary rabies immunization\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  currently have any active opportunistic infections\n          -  have received blood or blood product within previous 3 months\n          -  history of allergy to vaccine or any vaccine components\n          -  currently received anti-malarial drugs\n", "cuis": "C0042196 C1114735 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0439663 C1697762 C3842579 C3842580 C3842581 C0439631 C0034494 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0021053 C1552616 C1706244 C0042205 C0728859 C0419723 C0419724 C0419725 C0439663 C1697762 C3842579 C3842580 C3842581 C0034494 C0042196 C2713304 C0058773 C0419749 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0042210 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0439663 C0023185 C0947630 C1167909 C1167996 C0200635 C0853353 C0853986 C0580327 C0235914 C3809586 C0034494 C1550472 C0042196 C2713304 C0058773 C0419749 C0025260 C0700327 C1704326 C0042205 C0439663 C0021027 C0201278 C0042196 C2713304 C0058773 C0419749 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0274281 C0332157 C2220266 C1697762 C0034494 C0085393 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0439663 C0042205 C0243161 C0029118 C1842419 C1832324 C1320102 C0456388 C0005768 C0229664 C1561542 C0155668 C0262926 C2004062 C0020517 C0489531 C1527304 C0719113 C0719656 C3247823 C0042210 C0013227 C0003374 ", "concepts": "Vaccination, Vaccination AE, response, Response, Response, Infected, Booster, Booster 3, Booster 2, Booster 1, Primary, Rabies, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Immun summary, summary Rabies vaccination NOS, rabies vaccinations, First rabies vaccination, 2nd rabies vaccination, Third rabies vaccination, infected, Booster, Booster 3, Booster 2, Booster 1, rabies vaccination, Revaccinations, DT vaccination, vaccination dt, Response, Response, Response, vaccine description, prescription, prescription infected, learned, studies T lymphocyte count, B lymphocyte count, lymphocyte count, CSF lymphocyte count, low lymphocyte count, antibody response, Autoantibody response, Poor antibody response, rabies, low vaccination, Revaccinations, DT vaccination, vaccination dt, memory, memory, role rabies immunization, infected, Antibody, Antibody vaccination, Revaccinations, DT vaccination, vaccination dt, Response, Response, Response, Exposure, Exposure, exposure, booster, rabies immunocompromised criteria, Eligibility Criteria infected rabies immunization Criteria opportunistic infections, No opportunistic infections, Frequent opportunistic infections, Factive blood product, blood, blood, month, previous MI history, history, allergy, allergy, allergy, Callergy, dallergy, Dallergy, vaccine drugs, anti-malarials "}
