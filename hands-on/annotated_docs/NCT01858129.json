{"text": "TITLE:\n      Inhaled Corticosteroids for the Treatment of Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn\nSUMMARY:\n      Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN) is a common respiratory disorder affecting late\n      preterm and term babies caused by lung edema resulting from delayed absorption of fetal\n      alveolar lung fluid.\n      The investigators hypothesize that ENAC expression will be up-regulated as a result of\n      administration of corticosteroids. This effect will lead to enhanced absorption of fetal\n      lung fluid finally treating TTN. The aim of our study will be to evaluate whether inhaled\n      corticosteroids reduce respiratory distress and morbidity in late preterm and term neonates\n      presenting with TTN.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The primary outcome measure will be the assessment of respiratory distress reflected by TTN\n      clinical score in neonates presenting with TTN and treated with inhaled corticosteroids\n      compared to placebo.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Late preterm and term infants (post-menstrual age \u2265 34 weeks) delivered by cesarean\n             section or vaginal delivery\n          -  Diagnosis of TTN\n          -  Parents signed informed consent\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Meconium aspiration syndrome\n          -  Respiratory distress syndrome\n          -  Congenital heart disease\n          -  Non respiratory disorders causing tachypnea\n", "cuis": "C0158940 C0001617 C3539185 C3540725 C3540726 C3540727 C3536709 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0004048 C1720702 C1552616 C1706244 C0158940 C0035204 C0035242 C0029582 C0947780 C3245511 C0034063 C0285521 C0024523 C1963165 C3714745 C0024109 C0016286 C1440080 C0185117 C0001617 C3653466 C3539185 C3540725 C3540726 C3540727 C3536709 C0161508 C0239126 C1533734 C0376495 C0199808 C0199810 C0725057 C1536282 C0001563 C0036589 C0150270 C3469597 C1442948 C0024523 C1963165 C3714745 C0004048 C0947630 C0024109 C0016286 C0220825 C0476273 C0035220 C0436692 C0748355 C0877339 C0001617 C3653466 C3539185 C3540725 C3540726 C3540727 C3536709 C0161508 C0239126 C0220880 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0476273 C0035220 C0436692 C0748355 C0877339 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C0558058 C3242613 C0001617 C3653466 C3539185 C3540725 C3540726 C3540727 C3536709 C0161508 C0239126 C0004048 C3272565 C0332155 C0032042 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0025344 C0308779 C3841297 C0566690 C2114516 C1541822 C2094780 C1552858 C0007876 C0015252 C0728940 C0184905 C0011900 C0945731 C1561610 C2090600 C0009797 C0243161 C0025048 C0035222 C0035220 C2909981 C0158940 C0152021 C0455683 C0035204 C0035242 C0029582 C0947780 C0231835 ", "concepts": "Transient Tachypnea of Newborn, corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroid, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Inhale, Inhale summary, summary Transient Tachypnea of Newborn, respiratory disorders, respiratory disorder, other respiratory disorder, Respiratory disorders NEC, common lung edema, babie, malabsorption, Malabsorption, malabsorption lung, fluids, Alveolar expression corticosteroid, Anticorticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroid, Pois-corticosteroids, corticosteroid use, administration, Readministration, Dpt administration, Mmr administration, administration sets, Maladministrations, oral administration, self administration, Drug administration, drug administration, lead, malabsorption, Malabsorption, malabsorption inhaled, study, lung, fluids, Evaluate respiratory distress, Respiratory distress syn, O/E - respiratory distress, Acute respiratory distress, Cardio-respiratory distress, corticosteroid, Anticorticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroid, Pois-corticosteroids, corticosteroid use, morbidity description, prescription, prescription respiratory distress, Respiratory distress syn, O/E - respiratory distress, Acute respiratory distress, Cardio-respiratory distress, Assessment, assessments, Assessment, Assessment, IQ assessment, reflected, outcome measure type corticosteroid, Anticorticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroids, Corticosteroid, Pois-corticosteroids, corticosteroid use, inhaled, Clinical, untreated placebo criteria, Eligibility Criteria menstrual, deliver, Cesarean vaginal; delivery, vaginal delivery, Vaginal delivery, vaginal delivery only, section, C-section, resection, Resection, Bisection {Diagnosis}, Diagnosis signed, signed:, informed consent form Criteria Meconium aspiration syndrome Respiratory distress syndrome (finding), Respiratory distress syndrome in newborn, Respiratory distress syndrome, type I, Respiratory distress syndrome, type II Congenital heart disease, NOS, FH of congenital heart disease respiratory disorder, respiratory disorder, Other respiratory disorders, Respiratory disorders NEC, tachypnea "}
