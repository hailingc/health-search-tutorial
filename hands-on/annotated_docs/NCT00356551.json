{"text": "TITLE:\n      Family Spirit Study\nSUMMARY:\n      The goals of this study are to evaluate the effects of an in-home parenting education\n      program, called Family Spirit, on parenting knowledge and skills and decreasing alcohol and\n      substance use compared to a breast-feeding education. In addition, we will assess aspects of\n      mother/child interaction.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      To evaluate the study, we employed a randomized controlled design using a blocked\n      randomization procedure. In this procedure, single woman and women with a participating\n      father were randomized in equal numbers to the Family Spirit or the breast-feeding education\n      program.\n      Both treatment and comparison groups were assessed at multiple times. The number of times\n      depended on when the participant was recruited into the program. Women recruited into the\n      program between the study\u2019s start (May 2002) and January 31, 2004 were assessed at four\n      times: 1) The Pre-test occurs after informed consent (occurring at least 16 weeks before the\n      birth of the infant), 2) The Mid-Test at 6-8 weeks after the delivery of the infant, 3) The\n      Post-Test at 6 months post-partum (which is the end of the intervention period), and 4) The\n      6-month Follow Up Test occurs at 1 year post-partum. Women recruited into the program\n      between Februrary 1, 2004 and March 31, 2004 (the date recruitment ended) were assessed at\n      three times: 1) The Pre-test occurs after informed consent (occurring at least 16 weeks\n      before the birth of the infant), 2) The Mid-Test at 6-8 weeks after the delivery of the\n      infant, and 3) The Post-Test at 6 months post-partum (the end of the intervention period).\n      FHEs also conducted two instruments specific to child development: the HOME and the ITSEA.\n      The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) was administered at the\n      Post-Test and Follow-Up points (just the post-point for women recruited into the study\n      between February 1, 2004 and March 31, 2004). This measure was an observatory measure\n      completed by FHEs and provided a systematic measurement of the family environment. The\n      Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) was a self-report form completed by\n      parents at their Follow-Up visit (not completed for women recruited into the study between\n      February 1 and March 31, 2004). This measure assessed social-emotional problems and\n      competencies in 12- to 36-month olds. FHEs also administered a Client Satisfaction Scale to\n      mothers in the FSP group who completed their participation in the program. This Scale\n      assessed their satisfaction with the various curricular sections and their FHE.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Native American pregnant teens or
