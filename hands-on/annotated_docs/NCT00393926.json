{"text": "TITLE:\n      Robot-Assisted Motivating Rehabilitation\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of the study is to examine how a novel robot technology designed for eventual\n      use as a home therapy can improve arm function after stroke.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Typically, after brain damage due to a stroke, the affected arm is weak and suffering from\n      some of paralysis. As a result, adults with this condition are unable to move their impaired\n      arm well during their activities of daily living. Our research is focused on understanding\n      how best to improve the ability of the arm to move after brain damage due to a stroke. We\n      have implemented novel robot technology designed for eventual use as a home therapy device\n      and have used software and hardware technologies to design activities that can assess the\n      arm ability and engage the person during therapy. We will study how the prolong use of this\n      device with simple, functional, and engaging activities improve the arm's movement ability\n      and sustain motivation to use the arm over repeated therapy sessions and away from\n      supervision.\n      Overall, we will establish whether using our technology to perform tasks that are more or\n      less game-like and functionally relevant to driving will make a difference in the impaired\n      arm after stroke. Two groups of stroke survivors will be followed while they complete\n      therapy. We have three main aims. In aim #1, we will determine whether therapy using\n      functional tasks compared to simple rote tasks lead to significant increases in the use of\n      the arm during therapy and the arm improvements experienced by the subjects after the\n      therapy. In aim #2, we will measure how each group engage in the more and less functional\n      therapy and monitor their effort and enjoyment during training. This aim will help us to\n      determine the value of more fun training. In aim #3, we will upgrade our technology for use\n      in the home therapy environment and follow some subjects to determine if the results change\n      in under supervised condition (at home)\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n        Subjects will be included in the study on the basis of the following criteria:\n          -  They must be at least six months post-stroke.\n          -  18 years of age or older with a clinical diagnosis of hemiparesis (as verified by\n             medical record and a medical expert).\n          -  They have voluntary control with a low to medium range of motion function (UE-FT<5)\n             and a muscle tone.\n          -  They are functionally stable (no significant changes in motor function over a week)\n             and are able to tolerate being seated upright for 90 minutes.\n          -  They report no excessive pain the impaired arm.\n          -  If left neglect or spasticity is detected in the impaired arm, these levels must not\n             interfere with the ability to cognitively complete the tasks or turn a wheel.\n          -  They must not be participating in any experimental rehabilitation or drug therapies.\n          -  If subjects are receiving chemical injections for spasticity, they must be at least\n             3-months away from their last treatment.\n          -  They must have driven prior to stroke.\n          -  They are not clinically depressed (as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale\n             (GDS) short form (Sheikh and Yesavage, 1986).\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Subjects will be excluded from the study if they voluntarily decide to withdraw from\n             the study or if they do not meet the above inclusion criteria.\n        Once informed consent is given twenty-four of these subjects will be randomized into two\n        training groups (fun driving: fun and functional driving activities and rote tracking (12\n        subjects): rote and functional tracking activities). Two subjects will be randomized the\n        case study group. The groups will be matched in initial motor function.\n        Subjects will be excluded if they voluntarily decide to withdraw from the study or if they\n        do not meet the above inclusion criteria.\n", "cuis": "C0034991 C0007237 C0018459 C0080102 C0204601 C0728952 C3534574 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C0679622 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0031843 C1705273 C0087111 C0033972 C0038454 C0446516 C1140618 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0270611 C1456496 C0683278 C0038454 C3714552 C0446516 C1140618 C0522224 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C1299582 C2242847 C0451239 C0509063 C0203978 C0451039 C0451227 C3694100 C0582381 C3484221 C4034307 C1387108 C3649805 C0162340 C0446516 C1140618 C0270611 C1456496 C0038454 C0446516 C1140618 C0087111 C0033972 C0679622 C2239122 C2004436 C0037585 C0683887 C0087111 C0033972 C0947630 C0446516 C1140618 C0425152 C2239122 C2004436 C0425152 C0446516 C1140618 C0723323 C0031843 C0026649 C0026605 C3900051 C0087111 C0033972 C0446516 C1140618 C0233697 C0038842 C0282416 C0870814 C0085632 C3842396 C0038454 C1552839 C0446516 C1140618 C1815293 C0087111 C0033972 C1442948 C0723323 C0031843 C0087111 C0033972 C0446516 C1140618 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0087111 C0033972 C0425152 C0031843 C1552839 C0679105 C0018592 C3843346 C0087111 C0033972 C0030695 C0150369 C0181904 C0015264 C1552861 C0442694 C1554161 C0442694 C1554161 C0087111 C0033972 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0243161 C0947630 C0038454 C1561542 C0018989 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C3834725 C1555709 C1948032 C3272565 C0025102 C0551625 C1554096 C0746463 C0080078 C0150220 C2607871 C0576002 C2055622 C0576094 C1319209 C0031843 C1705273 C1550472 C3543419 C0549465 C0031843 C1705273 C1561540 C1299581 C0886384 C0684224 C0700287 C0030193 C0446516 C1140618 C0026838 C0442726 C1511790 C0521874 C0446516 C1140618 C0541749 C1815293 C0007237 C0034991 C0018459 C4042802 C0204096 C0204601 C0728952 C0419104 C0458264 C0013216 C0021485 C1533685 C0444600 C0026838 C3272558 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0038454 C0013126 C0011570 C0011581 C1999266 C4049644 C0344315 C0812393 C1579931 C0035143 C0520887 C2121458 C0175659 C0222045 C0349674 C0684254 C0243161 C0947630 C0424092 C3853865 C1552867 C0243161 C0947630 C3244317 C0009797 C2239122 C2004436 C1552839 C0442694 C1554161 C0562230 C2239122 C2004436 C0562230 C0085973 C0031843 C1705273 C1552839 C0947630 C0424092 C3853865 C1552867 C0243161 ", "concepts": "Rehabilitation, NOS, rehabilitation, habilitation, Rehabilitation NEC, Drug Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation;drug, Lung Rehabilitation summary, summary study, novel, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined function, Function, therapy, Cotherapy, stroke, arm, arm description, prescription, prescription brain damages, Brain damage, suffering, stroke, weak, arm, arm paralysis, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, unable activities of daily living (history), Katz activities of daily living, rnrx activities of daily living, Teach activities of daily living, Brief activities of daily living, Index of activities of daily living, activities of daily living goals, Assess activities of daily living, Activities of daily living score, Activities of daily living panel, training;
