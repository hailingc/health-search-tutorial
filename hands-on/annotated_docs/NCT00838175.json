{"text": "TITLE:\n      Characteristics Predictive of Success and Complications in the Use of Suture-Mediated Closure of Femoral Venous Access\nSUMMARY:\n      Suture-mediated closure devices are effective and safe for achieving rapid hemostasis in\n      femoral venous access site and reducing the incidence of complications associated with\n      traditional closure methods. Furthermore, there are predictive factors(such as sheath size,\n      obesity, procedure duration, and anticoagulation status)that we can use to assess the\n      procedure's likelihood of success in various patients.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients receiving suture-mediated\n      closure of the femoral vein following catheterization. All patients undergoing cardiac or\n      arterial catheterization by the Interventional Cardiovascular Medicine Service at The\n      Brigham and Women's hospital from 3/1/02 to the onset of the study and who had femoral\n      venous access during that time were considered for closure of the venous site; however, the\n      decision to use the closure device was left to the discretion of the physician.\n      Contraindications to using the closure device include a groin hematoma that had developed\n      during the procedure and/or difficult access due to extensive scar tissue from surgery or\n      multiple prior vascular accesses.\n      All in-hospital endpoints have been collected in the pre-existing Catheterization Laboratory\n      Database. Patient's data will be extracted from this database as indicated in the procedure\n      below. Each patient will be reviewed for clinical follow-up and the presence of adverse\n      events including but not limited to hematoma, thrombosis, blood loss, vascular imaging, the\n      need for additional procedures, and re-admissions within 30 days of closure. If necessary,\n      further data will be collected via a phone interview with the patients. Univariate and\n      multivariate analysis will be performed to determine the factors that predict inadequate or\n      incomplete closure or the development of complications mentioned in the section above. A\n      predictive model based on the identified risk factor will be developed and tested\n      prospectively in the next phase of this ongoing investigation.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  All consented pts. over the age of 18 who received sutured mediated femoral vein\n             following catheterization\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Pt.s who are unable to give consent.\n          -  Pts. whose participation in research is contraindicated for medical reasons are\n             excluded.\n", "cuis": "C0009566 C0802632 C1171258 C2708284 C4032686 C0127400 C0185003 C0015811 C0038969 C1546803 C0042449 C1947944 C0022396 C1552616 C1706244 C0740166 C0038969 C1546803 C0127400 C0750164 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0015811 C0025663 C0025664 C0683956 C2030574 C0003281 C2917212 C3537050 C0028754 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0038969 C0009068 C0947630 C0127400 C0007430 C0191117 C2025500 C2025504 C0398266 C0770826 C0015809 C0018787 C0007431 C0853509 C0581447 C0006259 C0007435 C0018795 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1721067 C3887460 C0007220 C0013227 C3243280 C1704289 C0015811 C0947630 C0750164 C0449616 C0679006 C0423908 C0804815 C1293323 C0585249 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C2363670 C0241158 C2004491 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C1299586 C0005847 C0007430 C0770826 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0242356 C0993637 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C3245479 C0185115 C1555707 C1444656 C0282443 C0392148 C3272565 C0546783 C0920428 C0040053 C2586211 C0302148 C0019080 C0553700 C0018944 C1962958 C3834249 C4049609 C4049610 C4050368 C0025664 C0184661 C0184666 C3842337 C0935630 C3245479 C0002778 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C1552858 C0007876 C0015252 C0728940 C0184905 C0392366 C0228018 C3853906 C0455624 C1553898 C1550043 C0600091 C2594846 C2363670 C1552578 C3245491 C0220825 C1261322 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0015809 C0038969 C0127400 C0007430 C0191117 C2025500 C2025504 C0398266 C0770826 C0243161 C1299582 C1444657 C0421315 C1273094 C3841427 C1552867 ", "concepts": "complications, Complications, complications, Complications Doc, No Complication, Mediated, Closure, Femoral, Sutures, Suture, Venous, Use, Job Characteristics summary, summary hemostasis, Sutures, Suture, Mediated venous access, Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, femoral methods, methods, predictive factor procedure duration, anticoagulation, Anticoagulation, Anticoagulation, obesity Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure description, prescription, prescription suture, sutur, study, Mediated catheterization, IVC catheterization, IVC catheterization, SVC catheterization, vein catheterization, catheterization kits, femoral vein, cardiac artery catheterization, Arterial catheterization normal, arterial catheters, Bronchial catheterization, central catheterization, heart catheterization, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, Interventional MRI, Cardiovascular, Cardiovascular drug, Medicine, x_Medicine, Services femoral, study venous access, Venous site decision, Indecision, Physician, Nose closure groin hematoma, contraindication, Contraindication, Contraindication, developer scar tissues, Scar tissue, Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure, surgery, surgery, surgery:, difficulty vascular Catheterization, Catheterization kit, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure, databases, Database, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, data, Extracted, extract, Indicated reviewed, presence, Clinical vascular imaging, cardiovascular imaging, Thrombosis, thrombosis, Thrombosis, Blood loss, Blood loss, hematomas, Hematoma, Unlimited, Unlimited, Unlimited, Unlimited procedures, Procedures, admissions, 0 days interview, data Analysis Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, development, Development, Development, Development, No development, section, C-section, resection, Resection, Bisection tested, teste, model, risk factors, risk factors, Identified, identifier, Ab identified, developer investigation, investigational, Investigation, Investigation criteria, Eligibility Criteria femoral vein, suture, Mediated catheterization, IVC catheterization, IVC catheterization, SVC catheterization, vein catheterization, catheterization kits Criteria unable Contraindicated, HRT contraindicated, OCP contraindicated, Medical reasons exclude "}
