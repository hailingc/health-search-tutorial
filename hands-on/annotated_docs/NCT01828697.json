{"text": "TITLE:\n      Comparison of Low and Intermediate Dose Low-molecular-weight Heparin to Prevent Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism in Pregnancy\nSUMMARY:\n      This is a randomized-controlled open-label trial comparing two different doses of\n      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in pregnant patients with a history of previous venous\n      thromboembolism (VTE). Both doses are recommended doses in the 2012 guidelines of the\n      American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), but it is not known which dose is more\n      efficacious in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism in pregnancy.\n      Patients enter the study and will be randomized as soon as a home test confirms pregnancy.\n      LMWH will be administered until 6 weeks postpartum. Follow-up will continue until 3 months\n      postpartum. Patients will be recruited by their treating physician, either an obstetrician\n      or internist.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Age: 18 years or older, and;\n          -  Pregnancy confirmed by urinary pregnancy test, and;\n          -  Gestational age < 14 weeks, and;\n          -  Previous objectively confirmed VTE, either unprovoked, in the presence of use of oral\n             contraceptives or estrogen/progestagen use, or related to pregnancy or the postpartum\n             period, or minor risk factors (e.g. long distance travel, minor trauma).\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Previous VTE related to a major provoking risk factor (e.g. surgery, major trauma or\n             plaster cast immobilisation in the 3 months prior to VTE) as the sole risk factor,\n             or;\n          -  Indication for treatment with therapeutic dose anticoagulant therapy (e.g. treatment\n             of acute VTE; permanent use of therapeutic anticoagulants outside of pregnancy), or;\n          -  Inability to provide informed consent, or;\n          -  Any contraindication listed in the local labelling of LMWH.\n", "cuis": "C1861172 C1550465 C2827755 C1968661 C4035123 C4035170 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0019134 C0770546 C0424653 C1305866 C2053618 C0012082 C1552616 C1706244 C1705425 C0180112 C2911690 C0018792 C0549206 C0019134 C0770546 C0262926 C2004062 C0424653 C1305866 C2053618 C0019139 C1550472 C0040038 C0455533 C0162791 C0220845 C0282423 C0817096 C1527391 C0804815 C3845898 C0040038 C0455533 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0947630 C0392366 C0456984 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C3810851 C0224086 C1719822 C0019139 C1561542 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0804815 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1114365 C1555709 C1948032 C0033010 C0549169 C0032976 C0358515 C0546577 C0232991 C0593622 C1148461 C2053598 C2721658 C0392148 C0018017 C2239270 C0009871 C0344225 C0009886 C0009881 C0009905 C0274536 C0481121 C0033306 C0628119 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0014939 C0202006 C0528521 C0720298 C2936882 C0233492 C0445356 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0025344 C1555670 C3263723 C3714660 C1446899 C0243161 C0332677 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0455624 C1553898 C0233492 C0445356 C0020944 C0185112 C0185113 C0558653 C1262163 C0032159 C0230463 C0455624 C1553898 C1561542 C0150457 C0455626 C1279808 C1697920 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C0003280 C0161530 C0261806 C3536711 C0238662 C0354604 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C1555587 C0009797 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C0019139 C2347943 ", "concepts": "Venous Thromboembolism, Intermediate, Intermediate, (3) Intermediate, ALS-Intermediate, BLS-Intermediate, pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
