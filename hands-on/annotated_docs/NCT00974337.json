{"text": "TITLE:\n      Relative Adrenal Insufficiency in Preterm Very Low Birth Weight Infants With Shock\nSUMMARY:\n      The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of relative adrenal insufficiency\n      in preterm very low birth weight infants with and without shock.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Till date, no studies are available that have evaluated the incidence of relative adrenal\n      insufficiency in preterm very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with shock. The focus had been\n      on stable preterm and critically ill preterm infants. Given that steroid treatment improves\n      blood pressure and stabilizes cardiovascular status in preterm infants with volume and\n      pressor-resistant hypotension,it becomes essential to examine the incidence of adrenal\n      insufficiency in this cohort (rather than a broad group of critically ill preterm infants).\n      Moreover, there are no studies on adrenal function in Indian neonates.\n      The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of basal and stimulated (using low dose\n      [1\u00b5g/k] ACTH) cortisol levels in preterm (28-34 weeks gestation) very low birth weight\n      (birth weight 750 gm to 1500 gm) infants with shock in the first week of life requiring\n      vasopressor therapy and matched (gestation, birth weight, postnatal age-matched)\n      hemodynamically stable infants ('control group').\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  All preterm (28 to 34 week gestation) very low birth weight (birth weight\n             750-1500grams.) infants born at AIIMS would be eligible for enrollment in the study.\n             Of these infants, those who meet the following criteria would be enrolled.\n          -  Cases: Preterm (28 to 34 week gestation) infants with birth weight between 750 and\n             1500 grams with shock in the first week of life requiring vasopressor therapy\n             (dopamine or dobutamine or both in a dose of > 10 mcg/kg/min)\n          -  Controls: Stable preterm (28 to 34 week gestation) infants with birth weight between\n             750 and 1500 grams who are matched for gestational age, birth weight, postnatal-age.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Major congenital malformations\n          -  Mother receiving anticonvulsant / anti-tubercular drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid)\n          -  Postnatal corticosteroid treatment\n          -  Refusal to give consent\n", "cuis": "C0001623 C0405580 C0035078 C1565489 C0151467 C0948387 C1963059 C0001403
