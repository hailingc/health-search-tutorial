{"text": "TITLE:\n      Prospective Cohort Study of the Effect of Bariatric/Metabolic Surgery on Morbid Obesity Patients With Metabolic Syndrome\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the change in kidney function and blood pressure\n      after gastric bypass versus conventional medical therapy in morbid obesity. The study mainly\n      focus on glomerular filtration rate(GFR) with known relation to the renal function and 24\n      hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after intervention of gastric bypass or medical\n      treatment.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with obesity and the patients with this syndrome\n      are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.\n      Obesity constitutes a strong risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease.\n      Among diabetics, obesity is known to amplify the risk for kidney disease.\n      Bariatric surgery has yielded dramatic results including longitudinal loss of excess body\n      weight and either complete reversal or significant improvement of several features of\n      metabolic syndrome. In addition, many observational studies have demonstrated significant\n      reduction in proteinuria after bariatric surgery.\n      However, the changes in the component of cardiovascular problem among metabolic syndrome and\n      changes in renal filtration function or progression to end stage kidney disease in morbidly\n      obese patients after weight loss surgery have not been extensively studied. Therefore, our\n      study mainly focus on glomerular filtration rate(GFR) with known relation to the renal\n      function and 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after intervention of gastric\n      bypass or medical treatment.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Morbid obesity (BMI>30) patients with one of comorbidity (type 2 diabetes,\n             dyslipidemia, or hypertension)\n          -  Morbid obese patients (BMI>35)\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Prior bariatric surgery\n          -  Malignancy (any type)\n          -  End stage renal disease\n", "cuis": "C0524620 C1456587 C0028756 C0947630 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0020649 C0725357 C2230142 C0020538 C2926615 C0180208 C0428889 C0428886 C0488053 C0497247 C0031843 C1705273 C0022646 C0227665 C0947630 C0418981 C2069680 C0017125 C0729258 C0028756 C0947630 C0022662 C0233492 C0017654 C1561549 C3845898 C0855316 C0017125 C0729258 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0150369 C1283169 C0026426 C0182230 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0524620 C1262289 C0039082 C0206064 C0796095 C0796110 C2936859 C2936904 C0028754 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0558373 C0849932 C0264656 C0042373 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C0022658 C1838421 C0260532 C0455686 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0028754 C1963185 C0455624 C1553898 C0022658 C1838421 C0260532 C0455686 C0241863 C0028754 C3845898 C1456587 C0152338 C0424653 C1305866 C2053618 C3844714 C1815293 C0524620 C1262289 C0947630 C1964257 C0478530 C0700325 C1456587 C0033687 C1962972 C0853155 C0441610 C0850760 C0042373 C0524620 C1262289 C1524073 C0022661 C3269157 C0242656 C0031843 C1705273 C1456587 C0028754 C0947630 C0022646 C0233492 C0017654 C1561549 C3845898 C0855316 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0150369 C1283169 C0026426 C0182230 C0031843 C1705273 C0038351 C0224155 C1304960 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0741847 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0011860 C1320657 C0028756 C0220880 C0242339 C0020473 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0028754 C0243161 C1456587 C0006826 C1306459 C0022661 C2316810 ", "concepts": "Metabolic Syndrome, Metabolic Surgery, Morbid Obesity, Study, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary Blood pressure, take blood pressure, blood pressures, low blood pressures, blood pressure kit, blood pressure leg, high blood pressure, High blood pressure, blood pressure cuff, Cuff blood pressure, mean blood pressure, Mean blood pressure, blood pressure rise, function, Function, kidneys, kidneys, study Medical therapy, medical therapy, gastric bypass, High gastric bypass, morbid obesity, study renal function, elation, glomerular filtration rate, Glomerular filtration rate, Uknown ambulatory blood pressure, gastric bypass, High gastric bypass, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, monitoring, Monitoring, monitoring BP, monitoring ph Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment description, prescription, prescription Metabolic syndrome, Dysmetabolic syndrome, syndrome, syndrome X, syndrome c, W syndrome, N syndrome, G syndrome, obesity CVD -
