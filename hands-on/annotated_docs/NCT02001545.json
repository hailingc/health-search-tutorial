{"text": "TITLE:\n      REal World Information on Cardiovascular Drug Management Patterns in Acute Coronary Syndrome paTients\nSUMMARY:\n      RE-ACT is a national, multi-centre, observational, prospective, longitudinal cohort study\n      which will include patients hospitalized for ACS within 24 hours of symptom onset and who\n      have a final diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or\n      non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This study aims to describe the\n      short-term (at the end of the first month after index event) antithrombotic management\n      patterns in a \"real-life\" setting for patients hospitalized with an acute coronary syndrome.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Provision of subject informed consent\n          -  Patients hospitalized and diagnosed with STEMI or NSTEMI\n          -  Hospitalized within 24 hours of onset of symptoms or transferred from another\n             hospital within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  STEMI and NSTEMI precipitated by or as a complication of surgery, trauma, or GI\n             bleeding or post-PCI.\n          -  STEMI and NSTEMI occurring in patients already hospitalized for other reasons.\n          -  Presence of any condition/circumstance which in the opinion of the investigator could\n             significantly limit the complete follow up of the patient (e.g. tourist, non-native\n             speaker or does not understand the local language, psychiatric disturbances).\n", "cuis": "C0948089 C0262754 C3887460 C0007220 C1561528 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C0262185 C1964257 C0478530 C0700325 C0404831 C3854058 C4049936 C0701159 C1457887 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727 C2348362 C1168331 C0455406 C0340324 C1998297 C0340312 C0340325 C0428950 C2825159 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727 C2348362 C1168331 C0455406 C0340324 C1998297 C0340312 C0340325 C0428950 C2825159 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0947630 C0376636 C1561542 C0918012 C0770655 C0948089 C0701159 C3887804 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0009797 C0077935 C0701159 C0011900 C1408353 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1457887 C0701159 C1457887 C0243161 C0009566 C1171258 C1148100 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C0161815 C0185026 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C3263723 C3714660 C0443121 C0019080 C0701159 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0392148 C0871010 C3845319 C1815293 C0630347 C0162340 C0233514 C1853842 C0033348 C2706915 ", "concepts": "Acute Coronary Syndrome, Drug Management, Cardiovascular, Cardiovascular drug, Information summary, summary study, act, Observational, observation, observation, multip, donation, Donation hospitalized, symptom Myocardial infarction, NOS, Myocardial infarction, Healed myocardial infarction, ECG: myocardial infarction, atrial myocardial infarction, Acute myocardial infarction, First myocardial infarction, septal myocardial infarction, Septal myocardial infarction, Apical myocardial infarction, FH: Myocardial infarction, Silent myocardial infarction, Recent myocardial infarction, Lateral myocardial infarction, Aborted myocardial infarction, ECG: no myocardial infarction, Date of myocardial infarction, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation Myocardial infarction, NOS, Myocardial infarction, Healed myocardial infarction, ECG: myocardial infarction, atrial myocardial infarction, Acute myocardial infarction, First myocardial infarction, septal myocardial infarction, Septal myocardial infarction, Apical myocardial infarction, FH: Myocardial infarction, Silent myocardial infarction, Recent myocardial infarction, Lateral myocardial infarction, Aborted myocardial infarction, ECG: no myocardial infarction, Date of myocardial infarction, elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation, study management, month, index, Rindex acute coronary syndrome, hospitalized, upsetting criteria, Eligibility Criteria informed consent form, urovision hospitalized, diagnosed, Undiagnosed, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient symptoms, hospitalized symptoms Criteria Complications, complications, NB complication, Complications, IUD complication, IUD complication, CNS complication, plication, surgery, surgery, surgery:, trauma, trauma, cryoprecipitated bleeding hospitalized condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, Presence, opinion Not significantly limited, Complete, touristil understand, Psychiatric disturbances, Psychiatric disturbances (25%), Language, Language "}
