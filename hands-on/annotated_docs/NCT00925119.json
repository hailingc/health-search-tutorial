{"text": "TITLE:\n      Examining Genetic Influence on Response to Beta-Blocker Medications in People With Type 2 Diabetes\nSUMMARY:\n      Beta-blockers are medications used to treat cardiovascular disease (CVD) symptoms, including\n      high blood pressure and chest pain. People with diabetes who receive beta-blockers may\n      experience adverse health effects, but the exact cause of why this happens remains unknown.\n      This study will examine the genetic factors that may influence how atenolol, a beta-blocker\n      medication, affects fat breakdown, blood sugar levels, and heart function in people with\n      type 2 diabetes.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      People with diabetes who develop CVD have worse health outcomes than people without diabetes\n      who develop CVD. Beta-blockers are medications used to treat high blood pressure, angina\n      (i.e., chest pain), arrhythmias, and other CVD conditions. While beta-blockers are effective\n      at treating these conditions, they may also have damaging effects on cholesterol or glucose\n      levels, thereby possibly lessening their ability to prevent CVD events in people with\n      diabetes. It is important to identify which patients may not benefit from receiving\n      beta-blocker medications. Genetic factors may influence how people respond to beta-blocker\n      medications. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of genetic variation on\n      beta-blocker-induced changes in insulin sensitivity, fat breakdown, and heart function in\n      people with type 2 diabetes.\n      This study will enroll people with type 2 diabetes. At a series of up to three baseline\n      study visits, participants will have a blood collection, a glucose tolerance test, an\n      echocardiogram to obtain images of the heart, and biopsies of muscle from the thigh and fat\n      from the stomach. All participants will then receive atenolol once a day for 8 weeks. During\n      Week 1, participants will receive a low dose of atenolol. They will then attend a study\n      visit at the end of Week 1, and study researchers will examine how well participants are\n      tolerating the medication. If the atenolol is well tolerated, the dose will be increased.\n      Study researchers will call participants 1 week after any dosage changes to monitor for side\n      effects. Blood collection will occur again at a study visit at Week 4. At Week 8,\n      participants will then attend up to three study visits for repeat baseline testing.\n      Participants will then be slowly tapered off of atenolol over a 1-week period.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Type 2 diabetes for more than 1 year before study entry\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Insulin therapy\n          -  Treatment with any beta-blocker in the 30 days before study entry\n          -  Asthma\n          -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n          -  Greater than first degree heart block\n          -  Heart rate less than 60 bpm\n          -  Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg\n          -  Raynaud's phenomenon\n          -  Known history of angina, heart attack, heart failure, coronary revascularization, or\n             automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators\n          -  Pregnant\n          -  Creatinine clearance less than 35 ml/min\n          -  Hematologic dysfunction (white blood cell[WBC] count less than 3000 or hematocrit\n             less than 28%)\n          -  Allergy to amide anesthetics\n", "cuis": "C0011860 C0013227 C0802604 C2598133 C2094204 C3840903 C3843493 C3843494 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0439096 C0332128 C0119053 C1552616 C1706244 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0558373 C0849932 C0264656 C0042373 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 C1457887 C0439096 C0020538 C2926615 C0857121 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0008031 C2926613 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0001645 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C1556133 C3541433 C0001645 C0004147 C2825715 C3652674 C0947630 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C1948182 C0392201 C0428554 C0020615 C0020456 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C0699900 C0031843 C1705273 C0018787 C0015677 C0001721 C2237113 C0011860 C1320657 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C1457868 C2363670 C0020538 C2926615 C0857121 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 C0002962 C2024883 C0439096 C2363670 C0003811 C0008031 C2926613 C0001645 C0012634 C0017725 C0012634 C0201950 C0014487 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C3858576 C0001645 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 C0119053 C0814287 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 C0947630 C1948182 C0220825 C0920563 C1864570 C0001645 C0699900 C0031843 C1705273 C0018787 C0015677 C0011860 C1320657 C0011860 C1320657 C0947630 C0728774 C0017741 C0029161 C0178665 C0202050 C0373622 C0947630 C0005768 C0229664 C0034770 C0600644 C1512346 C0013516 C2243117 C0183129 C2022421 C2022422 C2040661 C2022577 C2022578 C0005558 C0018787 C0039866 C0015677 C1696103 C0004147 C2825715 C3652674 C0038351 C1561538 C0947630 C1550472 C1512346 C0947630 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C0004147 C2825715 C3652674 C0236175 C0030695 C0150369 C0181904 C0947630 C1561540 C0229664 C0851353 C0947630 C1512346 C0034770 C0600644 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C0947630 C1512346 C0728774 C0004147 C2825715 C3652674 C0441640 C0025344 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0947630 C1552651 C1561543 C3843502 C0243161 C0021641 C0202098 C1533581 C1579433 C2739803 C3537244 C0087111 C0033972 C0001645 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0947630 C3842337 C0004096 C0024117 C0730604 C0494659 C1272221 C0730607 C0420047 C1273971 C3714496 C0730605 C1277261 C1273307 C1272095 C1303174 C1273972 C0865800 C0085614 C0018810 C0488794 C2041121 C2197023 C0488849 C0488855 C0488055 C0871470 C1306620 C0428883 C0488052 C1305849 C4071677 C0277884 C0488231 C1319895 C0488229 C4050449 C0034735 C0877341 C0018801 C0018802 C0027051 C0262926 C2004062 C0002962 C2024883 C0810516 C0021102 C0549206 C0373595 C0812399 C0580565 C3843322 C0018935 C0518014 C1542366 C0005768 C0229664 C0277785 C0200627 C1547985 C0002932 C0020517 C0718579 C1527304 C3539909 ", "concepts": "Type 2 Diabetes, medications, Medications, Medications, medications:, Medication 2, Medication 3, Medication 1, response, Response, Response, Beta, examining, Geneticin summary, summary CVD - cardiovascular disease, H/O: cardiovascular disease, Cardiovascular disease other, Acute cardiovascular disease, FH: Cardiovascular disease, Preg.+ cardiovascular disease, fear of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular renal disease, vascular disease, medications, medications:, Medications, Medications, medication:, Premedications, symptoms, Beta high;
