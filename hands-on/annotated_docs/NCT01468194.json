{"text": "TITLE:\n      Change in Peripheral Oxygen Saturation by Using Different Breathing Procedures in High Altitude\nSUMMARY:\n      In this investigation the researchers explore whether different types of breathing\n      procedures can improve the peripheral oxygen saturation to reduce the risk of becoming a\n      acute mountain sickness or a high altitude pulmonary edema.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a pathological effect of high altitude on humans caused by\n      acute exposure to low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude. It commonly occurs above\n      2500 meters of altitude. AMS appears as a collection of nonspecific symptoms acquired at\n      high altitude or in low air pressure resembling a case of \"flu, carbon monoxide poisoning,\n      or a hangover\".\n      It is caused by a drop in pressure and lowering partial pressure of oxygen during increasing\n      altitude. The direct consequence of those changes is a hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction\n      (Euler-Lijestrand-mechanism). In addition a rise in pulmonary blood pressure (Hypertonia)\n      can occur so that there is a higher risk of developing a high altitude pulmonary edema\n      (HAPE).\n      In this investigation the investigators are exploring whether different types of breathing\n      procedures can improve the peripheral oxygen saturation. We are comparing breathing with no\n      regulation with two different procedures of hyperventilation during trekking in different\n      altitudes. Procedure 1 (hyperventilation 1) describes inhalation during one step and\n      exhalation during the next step. Procedure 2 (hyperventilation 2) describes inhalation and\n      exhalation during one step.\n      The effect of the different breathing procedures can be quantified measuring the peripheral\n      oxygen saturation. In addition the investigators are comparing the breathing rate and the\n      minute ventilation as well as the expiratory end-tidal CO2-partial pressure of the three\n      different breathing procedures.\n      Furthermore, the investigators are examining the ability to concentrate in order to quantify\n      the effect of AMS on organ functions.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  acute clinically significant inter-current diseases\n", "cuis": "C0523807 C0746961 C0852710 C0184661 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0025664 C0035203 C0004048 C2015926 C1649428 C0235146 C1552616 C1706244 C1552578 C3245491 C0220825 C1261322 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0180799 C0523807 C2237091 C0746961 C1821453 C0025664 C0184661 C0340100 C3805914 C0238284 C0274293 C0002351 C3887755 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0238284 C0274293 C0002351 C3887755 C1384955 C1384955 C0274281 C0332157 C2220266 C0460139 C0030054 C0184633 C1550472 C1457887 C3245488 C0441074 C0034770 C0600644 C1649428 C0007020 C1264014 C0418294 C1384955 C0460139 C1550472 C3536832 C0021400 C0221100 C0393756 C0460139 C0030054 C0184633 C1820370 C0221106 C0024109 C2707265 C0242184 C3244286 C1456863 C0009813 C1261287 C1649428 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0020649 C0725357 C2230142 C0020538 C2926615 C0180208 C0428889 C0428886 C0488053 C0497247 C0026826 C0024109 C2707265 C0340100 C3805914 C3843761 C1552578 C3245491 C0220825 C1261322 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0523807 C2237091 C0746961 C1821453 C0025664 C0184661 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0020578 C0268053 C0025664 C0184661 C1156284 C0020578 C0268053 C0004048 C0354922 C0184661 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0020578 C0268053 C0004048 C0354922 C0184661 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0025664 C0184661 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0523807 C2237091 C0746961 C1821453 C0231832 C1301655 C0460139 C0025664 C0184661 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0332128 C0235198 C4050381 C1865273 C1522411 C3244315 C0178784 C0031843 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0012634 ", "concepts": "Blood Oxygen Saturation, Low Oxygen Saturation, Oxygen Saturation, High, {Procedure}, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, procedures, breathing, Breathing in, breathing, Altitude, High summary, summary investigation, investigational, Investigation, Investigation, in breathing, Breathing, breathing, Rebreathing, explorer oxygen saturation test, oxygen saturation, Low oxygen saturation, Oxygen saturation>85%, procedures, Procedures high altitude pulmonary edema, High altitude acute pulmonary edema, acute mountain sickness, Subacute mountain sickness, mountain sickness, mountain sickness description, prescription, prescription Acute mountain sickness, Subacute mountain sickness, mountain sickness, mountain sickness, high altitude high altitude, Exposure, Exposure, exposure, pressure, oxygen, oxygen, low symptoms, acquired, meters, Recollection, Collections, Altitude carbon monoxide poisoning, carbon monoxide poisoning chronic, [X]Self carbon monoxide poisoning, high altitude, pressure, low, air, flu Hangover, Hangover pressure, oxygen, oxygen, flowering, increasing ph pulmonary, Pulmonary, hypoxic, direct, Vasoconstriction, constriction, constriction, Altitude Blood pressure, take blood pressure, blood pressures, low blood pressures, blood pressure kit, blood pressure leg, high blood pressure, High blood pressure, blood pressure cuff, Cuff blood pressure, mean blood pressure, Mean blood pressure, blood pressure rise, Hypertonia, pulmonary, Pulmonary high altitude pulmonary edema, High altitude acute pulmonary edema, At higher risk investigation, investigational, Investigation, Investigation, in breathing, Breathing, breathing, Rebreathing oxygen saturation test, oxygen saturation, Low oxygen saturation, Oxygen saturation>85%, procedures, Procedures, in breathing, Breathing, breathing, Rebreathing hyperventilation, Acute hyperventilation, procedures, Procedures, ph regulation hyperventilation, Acute hyperventilation, inhalation, inhalations, Procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure hyperventilation, Acute hyperventilation, inhalation, inhalations, Procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure procedures, Procedures, in breathing, Breathing, breathing, Rebreathing oxygen saturation test, oxygen saturation, Low oxygen saturation, Oxygen saturation>85%, breathing rate minute ventilation, pressure procedures, Procedures, in breathing, Breathing, breathing, Rebreathing examining, inability to concentrate, Ability to concentrate, Inability to concentrate urine, Border, orders organ, function criteria, Eligibility Criteria diseases "}
