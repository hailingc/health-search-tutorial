{"text": "TITLE:\n      Postoperative Respiratory Depression After Cardiac Surgery\nSUMMARY:\n      Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is associated with postoperative respiratory\n      depression. In this study we aimed at investigating perioperative parameters that could\n      predict the nadir of postoperative respiratory function impairment.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a principal revascularization option for\n      ischemic heart disease and the principal modality for invasive treatment of coronary artery\n      disease. Postoperative pulmonary complications are the most frequent and significant\n      contributor to length of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality. The objective of this\n      study is to search for perioperative parameters that could predict the degree of impairment\n      of respiratory function after CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  patients of both sexes older than 18 years submitted to CABG with CPB, presence of\n             coronary disease confirmed by coronary angiography, use of the left internal thoracic\n             artery and/or saphena, patients who remained in spontaneous ventilation on the first\n             postoperative day, absence of chronic or acute pulmonary disease, and giving written\n             informed consent to participate in the study.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  intraoperative change of the surgical technique, surgical complications or\n             complications occurring in the ICU, emergency reoperation, renal failure, failure to\n             agree to continue in the study, presence of other types of heart disease, and\n             presence of pulmonary diseases.\n", "cuis": "C0235063 C0018821 C1552616 C1706244 C0010055 C1260596 C0396756 C0396767 C0396777 C0396783 C0396789 C1319321 C3698425 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0042497 C0087153 C2266627 C1546767 C2024161 C0011570 C0011581 C0344315 C0812393 C1579931 C1999266 C4049644 C0035143 C0429068 C0429108 C0520887 C0947630 C0449381 C0035203 C0024119 C0035227 C0231795 C4020855 C0684336 C3845945 C2598156 C2024161 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0010055 C1260596 C0396756 C0396767 C0396777 C0396783 C0396789 C1319321 C3698425 C0581603 C0581712 C0027686 C0472662 C0007794 C0027056 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0683525 C0151744 C1313980 C0010054 C1510446 C0264694 C0683468 C0205042 C1269008 C1261082 C0545743 C1547664 C0281169 C2069032 C0012634 C0018609 C0019993 C3840878 C3841837 C3841838 C0220880 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0684336 C3845945 C2598156 C1552603 C0542560 C0947630 C0449381 C0007202 C0429123 C0035203 C0024119 C0035227 C0231795 C4020855 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0392148 C1555709 C1948032 C0085532 C1633729 C0010068 C1956346 C0817096 C0729233 C3244072 C0412771 C1999010 C0003842 C0024115 C0455540 C0034072 C1561538 C0424530 C2024161 C0947630 C0009797 C0243161 C0221082 C0742723 C2133623 C0393404 C0025664 C1135564 C0543467 C0587668 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0035078 C0001623 C1963154 C3267129 C3810103 C1167727 C0035110 C0949626 C0543467 C3244306 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0018799 C2186266 C0392148 C0947630 C0024115 C0455540 C0034072 C0392148 ", "concepts": "Respiratory Depression, Cardiac Surgery summary, summary Coronary artery bypass graft operations, coronary artery bypass graft, Coronary artery bypass graft x 1, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 2, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 3, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 4, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 5, Coronary artery bypass graft occlusion, Coronary artery bypass grafting planned, surgery, surgery, surgery:, respirators, respirator, respirator, Respiratory, postoperative VSD Depressions, Depression, depression, depression, depression, Depression, Depression, Repression, PR depression, TU depression, depression st, study, Parameters Respiratory function, NOS, respiratory function tests, Respiratory function test, Normal respiratory function, Respiratory function loss, impairment, No impairment, Impairments, postoperative VSD description, prescription, prescription Coronary artery bypass graft operations, coronary artery bypass graft, Coronary artery bypass graft x 1, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 2, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 3, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 4, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 5, Coronary artery bypass graft occlusion, Coronary artery bypass grafting planned, revascularization, Devascularization, Neovascularization, Limb revascularization, brain revascularization, Heart revascularization, surgery, surgery, surgery:, options IHD -
