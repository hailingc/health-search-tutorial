{"text": "TITLE:\n      Pulmonary Embolism Response to Fragmentation, Embolectomy, & Catheter Thrombolysis: PERFECT\nSUMMARY:\n      A prospective observational study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness data of\n      catheter-directed therapy (CDT) including percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) for\n      treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE)\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The primary objective of this study is to capture high quality patient safety and\n      effectiveness data on CDT for acute PE. The goal will be achieved by capturing a concise set\n      of immediate and short-term functional and clinical outcome data for PE patients undergoing\n      CDT.\n      Secondary study objectives include the following:\n      - To assess and benchmark clinical practice patterns (patient selection, optimal technique,\n      use of procedure worldwide)\n      These objectives will be achieved through the capture of selected process data for patients\n      included in the registry. Data collected in this study may also be used to develop and\n      refine standards of care for use of CDT for PE and to facilitate the design of randomized\n      clinical trials\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Must be Age greater than or equal to 18\n          -  Obtain informed written consent.\n          -  Diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) (< 14 days)\n          -  Catheter-directed therapy (CDT) was performed to treat acute PE\n", "cuis": "C0034065 C0520997 C0733564 C0162575 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0085590 C1546572 C1704454 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C3245479 C1964257 C0478530 C0700325 C0220825 C0162578 C0085590 C1704454 C1546572 C0087111 C0033972 C0054696 C1140236 C0376356 C0699886 C0034065 C0585968 C0856722 C2882221 C0340537 C0349752 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C1113679 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0947630 C3245479 C0018017 C0054696 C1140236 C0036849 C1697779 C3245479 C0031843 C3272565 C0054696 C1140236 C0018017 C2239270 C0947630 C0027627 C0237607 C3245512 C0025664 C0554924 C3272565 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0018017 C2239270 C3245479 C4019275 C4019276 C0034975 C0947630 C2363670 C0038137 C0580931 C0054696 C1140236 C1096775 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1114365 C0811741 C0034065 C0585968 C0856722 C2882221 C0340537 C0349752 C0011900 C0085590 C1546572 C1704454 C0087111 C0033972 C0054696 C1140236 ", "concepts": "Pulmonary Embolism, Thrombolysis, Thrombolysin, Embolectomy, response, Response, Response, catheter, Catheter, catheter summary, summary study, data, Observational, observation, observation, Evaluate thrombectomy, Catheter, Catheter, Catheter, therapy, Cotherapy, cdt, cdt, pmt, Mechanical Pulmonary embolism NOS, Hx pulmonary embolism, Chr pulmonary embolism, Acute pulmonary embolism, pulmonary fat embolism, pulmonary air embolism, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment description, prescription, prescription patient safety, Objective, objective, Objective, study data, goal, cdt, cdt, set immediate, data, function, Clinical cdt, cdt objective, objective, study, secondary practices, practice, techniques, patient section, Clinical Procedure, procedures, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Subprocedure, Ct procedure objective, objective, data Data collected, Data collected, registry, study, developer standards, care, cdt, cdt clinical trials criteria, Eligibility Criteria Age Obtain informed written consent Pulmonary embolism NOS, Hx pulmonary embolism, Chr pulmonary embolism, Acute pulmonary embolism, pulmonary fat embolism, pulmonary air embolism, Diagnosed catheter, Catheter, catheter, therapy, Cotherapy, cdt, cdt "}
