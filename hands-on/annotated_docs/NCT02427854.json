{"text": "TITLE:\n      Palestinian Perineum and Birth Complication Study\nSUMMARY:\n      In this study the investigators want to assess complications associated to pregnancy and\n      delivery, and interventions used during labor.\n      Pregnancy and delivery related complications are a major health problem globally. Events\n      during labor such as excessive bleeding, uterine rupture, emergency cesarean delivery; other\n      instrumental deliveries and anesthesia problems are situations that potentially may lead to\n      severe outcomes for the mother and child.\n      Diabetes, anemia and hypertensive disorders may also complicate both the pregnancy and\n      delivery.\n      Between 60-80% of women delivering their first baby need suturing due to perineal tears\n      (tears located to the area between the vagina and anus). Superficial perineal tears rarely\n      cause long-term problems, but often lead to pain and discomfort immediately after birth.\n      Deeper or severe perineal tears, involving the anal sphincter, may influence the woman's\n      quality of life. This is mainly due to long-lasting pain, discomfort and sexual dysfunction,\n      and the fact that obstetric anal sphincter tear is the main cause of anal incontinence.\n      Recent clinical intervention studies have shown that the incidence of severe obstetric\n      perineal tears may be reduced by 50-70% by introducing a bimanual support technique of the\n      perineum. In these studies all midwives and gynecologists were trained in the bimanual\n      support technique. When it comes to training in new medical techniques in general, some\n      studies have shown that use of animated instructions on mobile phones may be a good\n      alternative to the more traditional \"hands-on\" or \"bedside\" teaching methods. In a global\n      perspective, it is important to study the efficacy of mobile units for transferring of new\n      knowledge, especially for use in resource constrained settings.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The main aim is to study the incidence of major delivery complications and perineal injuries\n      during vaginal delivery in Palestine. A manual support technique of perineum will be\n      introduced.\n        1. To assess the incidence of perineal tears, episiotomies, obstetric anal sphincter\n           injuries and major obstetric complications in Palestine in a multicenter study\n           involving three hospitals on the West Bank and three hospitals in Gaza.\n        2. To assess the present treatment of obstetric anal sphincter tears in Palestine.\n        3. To study whether intervention with bed-side training of the hands-on \"the\n           Norwegian-Finnish\" support technique reduce the incidence of obstetric anal sphincter\n           tears.\n        4. To study whether training by animated instructions of the same hands-on support\n           technique, using smart phones or tablet computers, reduce the incidence of obstetric\n           anal sphincter injuries.\n        5. To compare results between the two different training methods.\n        6. To study midwives' and doctors' attitudes towards \"hands-on\" training compared to\n           training by animated instructions. The main aim is to assess the incidence of perineal\n           injuries during vaginal delivery in Palestine, and to introduce a manual support\n           technique of perineum. Norwegian intervention studies have shown that the incidence of\n           obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) can be reduced by 40-70% by improving\n           hands-on delivering techniques. The reduction was achieved by educating all staff on\n           the delivery unit, implementing a new hands-on delivering technique. Some previous\n           research has shown that non-interactive training by animated instructions or videos in\n           emergency obstetric care, might be equally effective as conventional interactive\n           hands-on training. However, the effectiveness of training by animated instructions\n           compared to conventional training programs remains to be assessed properly. By\n           performing a multicentre intervention study, the investigators will explore the effect\n           of interactive hands-on training on the incidence of perineal injuries. Likewise the\n           investigators will study effect of non-interactive training by animated instructions.\n           Three hospitals on the West Bank (WB) and three in Gaza have accepted to participate.\n           The investigators will also assess whether attitudes towards training methods influence\n           the results.\n      The steps of observation, training and interventions in this study:\n        1. Intervention 1 (1 month):\n           Education in diagnosis and repair of perineal injuries and implementation of system to\n           register data.\n        2. Observation 1 (6 months):\n           Data-registration baseline.\n        3. Intervention 2, (6 months):\n           First part:\n           In all participating hospitals, the training in hands-on manual perineal protection\n           will be communicated by animated instruction accessible on tablet computers and smart\n           phones. The information and instructions how to perform the manual perineal protection\n           is transferred for the users by instruction video showing the method as an animation\n           with voice-over in Arabic and English. All 6 hospitals implement this intervention\n           simultaneously.\n           Second part, the stepped wedge approach:\n           After one month the first hospitals starts with the traditional bedside hands-on\n           training of the midwives and physicians. Norwegian midwives and obstetricians support\n           this training. The traditional bedside training then starts stepwise in the 6\n           hospitals, one month after each other, in a stepped wedge model.\n        4. Observation 2 (12 months):\n      There will be a one year observational period where all data is collected.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  all midwives and physicians working on labor ward in the participating hospitals.\n          -  all women giving birth in the participating hospitals.\n          -  both genders are included in the staff, and among the newborns\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  no exclusion criteria, the study aim is the education of the staff, and hospitals are\n             compared as units.\n", "cuis": "C2825536
