{"text": "TITLE:\n      Continuous Video- EEG Monitoring in the Acute Phase in Patients With a Cerebrovascular Attack- Randomisation of a Subpopulation Regarding Treatment Strategy\nSUMMARY:\n      Stroke is a major cause of epilepsy. The pathophysiological mechanisms of poststroke\n      epilepsy are not known. Subclinical epileptiform discharges could contribute to the neuronal\n      damage and influence functional outcome. Electro-encefalography (EEG) is the golden standard\n      to detect interictal, ictal and subclinical epileptic brain activity.\n      Patients admitted to the stroke unit with an ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular attack\n      will undergo a 24 hours video-EEG monitoring to detect epileptiform discharges. Clinical and\n      paraclinical (imaging, serum markers of neuronal damage) parameters will be analysed\n      together with the EEG results. The EEG results will be correlated with the occurence of\n      epileptic seizures and functional outcome and mortality in the acute phase and in the\n      long-term. When subclinical epileptic discharges are found on the EEG, patients will be\n      asked to participate in a second part of the study where they will be randomised into a\n      treatment (with an anti-epileptic drug) versus no-treatment group for a period of 6 months.\n      Outcome parameters will be the occurrence of epileptic seizures, mortality and functional\n      outcome.\n      Our main hypothesis is that the occurrence of subclinical epileptiform discharges during the\n      acute phase following stroke influences functional outcome.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients with ischemic arteria cerebri media infarct and spontaneous intraparenchymal\n             bleeding\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients with subarachnoidal haemorrhage, traumatic haemorrhage (epidural/subdural\n             bleeding), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, epilepsy, anti-epileptic treatment,\n             transient ischemic attack, indication for urgent neurosurgical intervention\n", "cuis": "C0150369 C1283169 C0026426 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C1547229 C1547295 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0699795 C1304680 C3463807 C0679199 C3179957 C1552616 C1706244 C0014544 C0038454 C0277785 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C0014544 C3845898 C0010957 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0031843 C0013812 C1546616 C1550631 C0443158 C0014544 C0442726 C0184666 C0809949 C0038454 C1304680 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0022116 C0019080 C0150369 C1283169 C0026426 C0182230 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C3272565 C0442726 C0079595 C0010957 C0229671 C0005516 C0449381 C0179038 C0014544 C2236802 C3495874 C0562230 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C0014544 C0947630 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0014544 C0025344 C0013227 C1254351 C1561542 C1552839 C0014544 C2236802 C3495874 C0449381 C0562230 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C0038454 C0031843 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0021308 C0149566 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0022116 C0019080 C0243161 C0019080 C0017181 C0812144 C1283259 C1550254 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0338573 C0151945 C0740384 C0014544 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0019080 C0007787 C0917805 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 ", "concepts": "monitoring, Monitoring, Monitoring;BP, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Acute, Acute, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Attack, Attack, Video, strategy, Stratego summary, summary epilepsy, Stroke, pathophysiology discharge, discharge, discharge, epilepsy, Uknown damage, standards, Standard, Standard, function, Electrode, Electrode, Electrode brain activity, epileptic, detect admitted, Admitted, stroke, attack, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, ischemia, hemorrhage monitoring, Monitoring, monitoring BP, monitoring ph, discharge, discharge, discharge, Clinical, detect imaging, damage, serum, marker, Parameters, analyser Epileptic seizures NOS, nonepileptic seizures, Non-epileptic seizure, hand function discharge, discharge, discharge, epileptic study Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, epileptic, period, drug, drug, month, groups Epileptic seizures NOS, nonepileptic seizures, Non-epileptic seizure, Parameters, hand function discharge, discharge, discharge stroke, function criteria, Eligibility Criteria infarct, Arteria cerebri media, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, ischemia bleeding Criteria haemorrhage, GI haemorrhage, epidurals, Epidural, Epidural, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cerebral venous thrombosis, venous sinus thrombosis, epilepsy, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, bleeding Transient ischemic attack, Transient ischemic attacks, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions "}
