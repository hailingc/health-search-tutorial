{"text": "TITLE:\n      The ACE Follow-up Study\nSUMMARY:\n      The Articulating Circular Endoscopic (ACE) Stapler is an investigational system using\n      endoscopic guidance to trans-orally place plications in the stomach in obese subjects to\n      reduce volume and expansion of the fundus and greater curve to abate hunger as part of a\n      supervised weight reduction program.\n      The primary objective of this study is to perform an evaluation of the safety of the\n      plication procedure.\n      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the ACE\n      Stapler for the treatment of obesity over a 24 month follow-up period.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This study was originally sponsored by BaroSense, Inc (protocol 11-03). 69 subjects were\n      enrolled and treated as part of the study at 6 centers in 4 countries outside the United\n      States. On April 30, 2013 BaroSense Inc went out of business and the study was terminated\n      with all participating centers' Ethics Committees. At the point of study termination, all\n      patients were in the middle of post procedure follow-up.\n      Boston Scientific has since acquired the technology and study and will re-initiate follow-up\n      to 24 months in order to collect data to support the original safety and efficacy endpoints\n      of the protocol. Only the 69 subjects previously enrolled and treated in BaroSense's\n      protocol 11-03 will be eligible for participation in the Boston Scientific continued\n      follow-up study (\"The ACE Follow-up Study\" protocol 90891629). The Boston Scientific\n      protocol will be approved by participating centers' Ethics Committees and patients who\n      choose to participate in The ACE Follow-up Study will need to sign a new, Ethics Committee\n      Approved, informed consent form.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          1.

Subject must have failed standard obesity therapy of diet, exercise, behavior\n             modification, and pharmacologic agents either alone or in combination, as assessed by\n             an interview with a member of the study team at baseline.\n          9. Subject agrees to refrain from any type of reconstructive surgery that may affect\n             body weight such as mammoplasty or abdominal lipoplasty or liposuction, during the\n             trial.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          1.
