Healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 40 years inclusive\n          2. Compliant with protocol procedures and available for clinical follow-up through the\n             last planned visit (V9)\n          3. Physical examination and laboratory results without clinically significant findings\n          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) \u2265 18.0 and \u2264 32.0 kg/m2\n          5. Females: Negative human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test (serum) for women\n             presumed to be of reproductive potential on the day of enrolment\n          6. Females of childbearing potential must use acceptable methods of birth control during\n             the trial and Follow-up period (from 6 weeks before the first administration of the\n             test vaccine for the duration of the trial i.e., until the last planned visit (V9)).\n             The following methods of birth control are acceptable when used consistently and\n             correctly: established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of\n             contraception; intrauterine devices (IUDs) or intrauterine systems (IUSs) with the\n             exception of steel or copper wire; barrier methods of contraception (condom or\n             occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] with spermicidal\n             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository); true abstinence (periodic abstinence [e.g.,\n             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal and postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not\n             acceptable).\n          7. Males must use reliable forms of contraception (barrier method with spermicidal agent\n             or true abstinence) and must refrain from sperm donation during the trial and\n             Follow-up period i.e., until the last planned visit (V9).\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          1. Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the\n             trial vaccine within 4 weeks preceding the administration of the trial vaccine, or\n             planned use during the trial period\n          2. Subject has received any other licensed vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the\n             administration of the trial vaccine\n          3. Subject has received any investigational or licensed rabies vaccine previously\n          4. Intending to travel to regions/countries for which rabies vaccinations are\n             recommended or where high risk of infections exists according to travel\n             recommendations by the German Society of Tropical Medicine and International Health\n             (DTG) during the trial and up to V9 (Day 91/120) Follow-up\n          5. Any treatment with immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months\n             prior to the administration of the trial vaccine. The use of inhaled and nasal\n             steroids, as well as topical steroids outside the vaccination area, will be permitted\n          6.

Administration of immunoglobulins (Igs) and/or any blood products within the 3 months\n             preceding the administration of the trial vaccine\n          9. Subject is taking chloroquine for malaria treatment or prophylaxis\n         10. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Acute disease is defined as the presence of a\n             moderate or severe illness or fever \u2265 38 \u00b0C measured orally\n         11. Presence or evidence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or\n             psychiatric illness (subjects with uncomplicated chronic diagnoses stable and treated\n             for \u2265 3 months e.g., mild hypertension well-controlled with medication, may be\n             enrolled - provided the condition and its therapy are known not to be associated with\n             an immunocompromised state or an autoimmune disease\n         12.
