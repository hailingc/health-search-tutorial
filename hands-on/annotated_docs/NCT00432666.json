{"text": "TITLE:\n      IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) Versus Placebo in the Treatment of Post-stroke Spasticity of the Upper Limb\nSUMMARY:\n      IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) is a botulinum toxin type A preparation free from complexing\n      proteins, i.e. free from proteins other than the active toxin. Injected into the muscle,\n      incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) causes local weakening. Botulinum toxin type A is widely used\n      for treatment of various neurological conditions. This study will investigate the efficacy\n      and safety of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) in the treatment of post-stroke spasticity of the\n      upper limb.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Main Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Female or male patients \u2265 18 years\n          -  \u2265 6 months since the last stroke, diagnosed by an appropriate health care\n             professional (e.g., neurologist)\n          -  Focal spasticity with \u2265 2 points on the Ashworth Scale in the wrist flexors with\n             clinical pattern Flexed Wrist\n          -  Focal spasticity with \u2265 2 points on the Ashworth Scale in the fingers flexors with\n             clinical pattern Clenched Fist\n          -  For pre-treated patients only: source documentation of the most recent injection\n             session with Botulinum Toxin and sufficient therapeutic response for Flexed Wrist and\n             Clenched Fist\n          -  For pre-treated patients only: the most recent injection with Botulinum Toxin must\n             have been maximal 50 Units BOTOX\u00ae or 200 Units Dysport\u00ae or 2000 Units Neurobloc\u00ae\n             (type B preparation) per each of these flexors: carpi ulnaris, digitorum\n             superficialis, digitorum profundus\n          -  For pre-treated patients only: the most recent injection with Botulinum Toxin must\n             have been maximal 60 Units BOTOX\u00ae or 240 Units Dysport\u00ae or 2400 Units Neurobloc\u00ae\n             (type B preparation) for flexor carpi radialis\n        Main Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Spasticity of any other origin than stroke\n          -  Previous treatment with Botulinum Toxin of any serotype and for any body region\n             within the 4 months prior to Screening (Visit 1, Day -7)\n          -  Planned concomitant treatment with Botulinum Toxin of any serotype and for any body\n             region\n          -  Previous or planned treatment with phenol- or alcohol-injection in the target limb\n          -  Previous surgical treatment of spasticity in the target muscle(s)\n          -  Fixed contracture, defined as severe restriction of the range of joint movement on\n             passive stretch\n          -  Severe atrophy of the target limb muscles\n", "cuis": "C0006050 C2930113 C2958914 C2719424 C0026838 C1140618 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704
