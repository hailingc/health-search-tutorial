{"text": "TITLE:\n      ACE Stapler Sub Study\nSUMMARY:\n      Obesity and its associated conditions have reached epidemic proportions. Estimates are that\n      about one third of the adults in the United States have obesity. At this moment there are\n      many therapeutic approaches for the treatment of obesity. But, efficacy of most treatment\n      options are limited and so far surgical intervention has been proven to be the only strategy\n      to overcome severe obesity. However, bariatric surgery has limitations and risks, which\n      might be minimized by non-incisional endoscopic procedures.\n      BaroSense developed a new device, called the Articulating Circular Endoscopic (ACETM)\n      Stapler, which can be used in the treatment of obesity. It is a trans-oral procedure, which\n      intends to reduce the ability of the stomach to expand by creating plications in the region\n      of the fundus and greater curvature. In contrast with other bariatric surgery it is\n      endoscopically performed, reversible and if it fails most future surgical options are still\n      open.\n      The main study ('Open, prospective study to evaluate the safety and preliminary\n      effectiveness of the BaroSense ACE\u2122 Stapler for the treatment of obesity', multicenter study\n      (MUMC+, AMC and St. Antonius), accepted by MEC AMC) seeks to determine the safety and\n      efficacy of this plicating system for patients with severe obesity.\n      In this sub-study we want to unravel the exact mechanism and provide more information about\n      the efficacy of the BaroSense ACE\u2122 Stapler. Therefore we will measure changes in various\n      parameters that are known to affect weight loss and metabolism, before and after gastric\n      plication (by using the BaroSense ACE\u2122 Stapler) in overweight subjects (these parameters\n      will only be measured in patients at MUMC+). These parameters are post-prandial satiety,\n      food-reward and related brain signalling, gastric emptying, behaviour towards food, food\n      intake, satiety hormone release, microbiota composition and inflammatory markers.\n      Objectives:\n      Aim of the present study will be to assess the effect of the BaroSense ACE\u2122 stapler on\n      postprandial satiety, food-reward and related brain signalling, gastric emptying, behaviour\n      towards food, food intake, hormone release, microbiota composition and inflammatory markers.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n        Criteria for inclusion in main ACE stapling study:\n          -  Subject must be able to understand and be willing to sign an informed consent\n             document.\n          -  Subject must be willing and able to participate in all aspects of the study and agree\n             to comply with all study requirements for the duration of the study.
