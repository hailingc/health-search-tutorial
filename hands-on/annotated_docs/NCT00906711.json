{"text": "TITLE:\n      Analysis of Balance in the Aging Process\nSUMMARY:\n      Introduction: While growing older, it is possible to notice a decrease in the functional and\n      physiological reserves in the organism which impairs the the abilities in the elderly in\n      doing some tasks. A simple balance becomes a challenge.\n      Objective: To evaluate the functional balance in the aging process.\n      Methods: The group was formed by 48 people from 10 to 85 years old. The evaluation\n      instruments are the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment\n      (POMA), the Unipodal Support Test, the Functional Reach Test and the Romberg's Test.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      48 individuals of both sexes and aged between 10 and 85 years were chosen. These individuals\n      were divided according to age, into four groups (each group containing 12 individuals, 6 men\n      and 6 women): Group I (G1): 10 - 18, Group II (G2): 20 - 35; Group III (G3): 45 - 60, Group\n      IV (G4): 65 - 85.\n      The instruments used for assessment of the balance were: (1) Berg Scale - consists of 14\n      items with common activities of daily life, with progressive degree of difficulty (2)\n      Assessment of Gait and Balance for Performance Oriented (POMA), consists of a protocol that\n      evaluates the static and dynamic balance, with operations similar to the activities of daily\n      living, (3) Test Support Unipodal; (4) adapted Functional Reach Test, which assesses the\n      stability in the standing position, (5) Test and Romberg Romberg's test Romberg-Barr\u00e9 or\n      sensitized conducted in stable and unstable soil, and all positions were first with open\n      eyes and then with closed eyes. The duration of each exposure was 30 seconds, with different\n      positioning of the feet.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Absence of the basic pathology that interferes directly in the balance\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Neurological changes\n          -  Cognitive impairment\n          -  Orthopedic injury\n          -  Use of orthoses for lower limb\n          -  Obesity\n          -  Exercise frequently (more than twice a week)\n          -  The bearer of any commitment to stay in their standing position\n", "cuis": "C1510835 C0002778 C0014653 C0179199 C0560184 C1588717 C1552616 C1706244 C1293116 C4075581 C0031843 C1555709 C1948032 C0231170 C0805586 C2347900 C2348080 C0798503 C0014653 C2174421 C0179199 C0542274 C1397014 C3497399 C0723323 C0018017 C2979883 C2239270 C0014653 C2174421 C0179199 C0542274 C1397014 C3497399 C0001811 C0034634 C0031843 C0220825 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0025663 C2827714 C2828387 C1552839 C0348000 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1261322 C2826217 C1961028 C0425245 C2698482 C0014653 C0179199 C0560184 C1588717 C0175659 C0222045 C0349674 C0684254 C0183683 C0344211 C1171411 C1317973 C0015458 C2584321 C0022885 C0456984 C1705273 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C1552839 C0441843 C2826263 C1960377 C0348000 C0175659 C0222045 C0349674 C0684254 C2239122 C2004436 C1299586 C3842554 C3245511 C0542560 C3839460 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1261322 C2826217 C1961028 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0014653 C0179199 C0560184 C1588717 C0016928 C3244306 C0543467 C0035110 C0949626 C2239122 C2004436 C0014653 C2174421 C0179199 C0542274 C1397014 C3497399 C0183683 C0344211 C1171411 C1317973 C2584321 C0022885 C0456984 C1705273 C0015421 C0456387 C4019422 C0850310 C0031809 C1261322 C1737178 C0231472 C0015458 C0022885 C0456984 C0392366 C1444783 C0443343 C0681324 C0029957 C0486616 C0509489 C0274281 C0332157 C2220266 C0015392 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C0150305 C0556030 C1561964 C0016504 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0677042 C0919386 C0014653 C2174421 C0179199 C0542274 C1397014 C3497399 C0424530 C0877217 C1137023 C0243161 C2707261 C0338656 C1270972 C1839000 C3808641 C0009241 C3263723 C0023216 C0153665 C1269079 C0029365 C1947944 C0028754 C1963185 C1522704 C0452240 C1561540 C0231472 C0870312 ", "concepts": "Aging Process, Analysis, Balance, Balances, Balance, Balancer summary, summary Introduction, Introduction kit, function, folder, Folder disabilities challenges, Rechallenge, Dechallenge, Challenge, balance, balance, balances, balances, Imbalance, Rebalance, simplet objective, Objective, objective, balance, balance, balances, balances, Imbalance, Rebalance, aging, raging, function, Evaluate Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, Method, Method, Method, groups instruments, assessment, Assessment, Assessment, assessment, No Assessment, Oriented, Mobility, nobility, Balance, Balances, Balance, Balancer, Scales, Scales, Scale, Scaler Supports, Support, Support, Support, Romberg, Reach, Test, Test, Function description, prescription, prescription groups Group I, Group ID assessment of balance, instruments, Scales, Scales, Scale, Scaler activities, activities:, difficulty, No difficulty, common, degree, Nonprogressive assessment, Assessment, Assessment, assessment, No Assessment, Oriented, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Balance, Balances, Balance, Balancer, Gait operations, operation, Reoperation, Reoperation, activities, activities:, balance, balance, balances, balances, Imbalance, Rebalance Supports, Support, Support, Support, Reach, Test, Test, Function, Glasses, classes, Classes, possess, assessment, assessment, Lvf assess standing position, Romberg, Test, test, test, Instability unstable, expositions, Ovipositions, compositions closed eyes, Exposure, Exposure, exposure, eyes, Induration, Duration, Duration positioning, Repositioning, Positioning, feet criteria, Eligibility Criteria pathology, pathology, balance, balance, balances, balances, Imbalance, Rebalance, Absences, Abasic, basica Criteria Neurological cognitive impairments, Cognitive impairment, mild, Cognitive impairment (CVS+), Cognitive impairment (rare), Cognitive Impairment injury lower limbs, Lower limb, Lower limb, orthoses, Use Obesity, Obesity Exercise, Exercises, week standing position, commitment "}
