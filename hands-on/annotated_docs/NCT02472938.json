Patients will be randomized in a\n      2:1 ratio to receive either BG00012 240 mg BID or placebo for 24weeks.\n      The primary objective of the study is to assess the early efficacy of treatment with BG00012\n      240 mg BID in the brain of newly diagnosed and naive-to-treatment patients with RRMS.\n      Secondarily, the time course of this beneficial effect will be assessed and the safety of\n      BG00012 will be evaluated.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      BG00012, a new oral formulation of dimethyl fumarate, has been recently approved by Food and\n      Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of adult\n      patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).\n      Its mechanism of action appears to be mediated, at least in part, through activation of the\n      nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant response pathway, a\n      critical cellular defense mechanism for mitigating oxidative, inflammatory, and xenobiotic\n      stress.\n      Inflammation in relapsing MS is indicated by the infiltration of immune cells into the CNS\n      and consequent damage to the blood-brain barrier that can be visualized on\n      gadolinium-enhanced MRI.\n      BG00012 has shown to produce a significant beneficial effect on clinical as well as MRI\n      efficacy parameters in RRMS in two pivotal Phase III trials, namely DEFINE and CONFIRM. In\n      particular, BG00012 has shown to significantly reduce the proportion of patients with\n      relapse, the ARR, disability progression (DEFINE) and the mean number of Gd+, T2- and\n      T1-weighted MRI lesions compared to placebo after two years treatment.\n      Additionally to clinical effects as well as on conventional MRI scans, that are very\n      sensitive to focal white matter pathology in MS, BG00012 has shown to determine significant\n      improvements in Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR) in both whole brain and normal appearing\n      brain tissue (NABT) at 24 weeks and 2 years compared to baseline in DEFINE study. In DEFINE\n      study, MTR analysis of Gd+ lesions has also been performed, however, due to the intense\n      suppression of Gd+ lesion activity of BG00012 treatment, data from only 7 patients in the\n      active arm compared to 29 in the placebo group were available and differences were not\n      observed between treatment arms. Changes in MTR of the brain have been shown in animal\n      models to be sensitive to changes in myelin content; MTR decreases with acute demyelination\n      and increases with myelination. MTR can be used to detect changes in myelin density in NABT\n      as well as in focal lesions of patients with MS, thus representing a new valuable tool for\n      assessing the effects of disease-modifying therapies in MS.\n      Additionally, results of post-hoc analyses of pooled data from DEFINE and CONFIRM studies\n      show that BG00012 240 mg BID has a major effect on the subgroup of na\u00efve-to-treatment and\n      newly diagnosed patients, who were randomized within one year (median time) from the MS\n      diagnosis. In this subgroup, the ARR, the number of Gd+, T2- and T1-weighted MRI lesions was\n      reduced by 56%, 92%, 80% and 68%, respectively, in the BG00012 group compared to placebo.\n      The mechanism of action of BG00012 and the relevant clinical efficacy on inflammatory\n      conventional MRI parameters, mainly Gd+ lesions, provide support for a further investigation\n      of BG00012 in newly diagnosed and na\u00efve-to-treatment RRMS patients. Furthermore, no\n      information regarding the MRI onset of efficacy of BG00012 treatment in this group of\n      patients is currently available neither data on improvement of MTR changes in whole brain,\n      NABT and Gd+ lesions that treatment with BG00012 can provide. Furthermore, no data regarding\n      the effect of Tecfidera on the accumulation of brain cortical lesions are available.\n      The primary goal of this study is to assess the MRI short-term onset of efficacy of BG00012\n      in newly diagnosed and na\u00efve-to-treatment patients with RRMS. For this purpose, a\n      conventional MRI efficacy primary endpoint will be evaluated.\n      Exploratory objectives of the study are to assess MTR changes of whole brain, NABT and Gd+\n      lesions at 24 weeks, mean number of cortical lesionsand brain volume changes in newly\n      diagnosed and na\u00efve-to-treatment patients after 24 week treatment with BG00012 compared to\n      placebo. As recently demonstrated, a higher cortical lesion load has been clearly associated\n      with a higher rate of progression in disability, as measured by the EDSS, and cortical\n      lesion volume was found to be an independent predictor of future cognitive status.\n      This is a phase IV, interventional, multicenter, randomized, double blind,\n      placebo-controlled, 24 week study to assess the MRI onset of efficacy of BG00012 240 mg BID\n      in newly diagnosed na\u00efve-to-treatmentRRMS patients.\n      The study will enroll 150 patients in 20 centers in Italy. Patients will be randomized in a\n      2:1 ratio to receive either BG00012 240 mg BID or placebo for 24 weeks. The study period\n      will consist of screening,24-week treatment and 4-week follow-up.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n        To be eligible to participate in this study,
