{"text": "TITLE:\n      Healthy Body Study\nSUMMARY:\n      Few obesity prevention programs have produced weight gain prevention effects that persist\n      over long-term follow-up and those that have are extremely lengthy, averaging 52 hr in\n      duration, making implementation difficult and costly. The 2010 US Preventative Services Task\n      Force (USPSTF) recommendations for treating child & adolescent obesity state that programs\n      should have \u2265 25 hr of comprehensive treatment including dietary, physical activity and\n      behavioral counseling, and that programs with < 25 hr usually do not produce improvements.\n      The implication is that, if centers cannot provide this level of service (as most cannot),\n      it is not worth providing any kind of treatment at all. In extreme exception to this, an\n      intensive 3-hr non-restrictive obesity prevention program involving participant-driven\n      healthy lifestyle improvement plans designed to bring caloric intake and output into balance\n      (Healthy Weight) has been found to significantly reduce increases in BMI and obesity onset\n      relative to alternative interventions and assessment-only controls through 3-yr follow-up.\n      We propose to test an extended 6-hr version of the Healthy Weight intervention in a sample\n      of primarily low SES, minority adolescents and young adults who are overweight and report\n      body dissatisfaction and subthreshold eating disorder symptoms, as these are prevalent risk\n      factors for obesity. We will test the hypothesis that participants assigned to the Healthy\n      Weight vs. control intervention will have significantly lower BMI and % body fat during\n      follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include body dissatisfaction, depressive symptoms, and\n      eating disorder symptoms. 300 adolescents and young adults at high risk for future weight\n      gain by virtue of their age, BMI percentile, body dissatisfaction and eating disorder\n      symptomatology will be randomized to Healthy Weight or weight control educational video.\n      Participants will complete assessments of BMI, body composition, potential mediators, and\n      other outcomes at pretest, posttest and 6--mo follow-ups (in yr 1). Thus, to refute the\n      USPSTF recommendations statement, we propose to show that a 6-hr intervention led by\n      graduate students can produce significant reductions in risk for both obesity and eating\n      disorders, suggesting this inexpensive and brief intervention could and should be rolled out\n      nationwide.\n      Primary Aim: To test the hypothesis that Healthy Weight will significantly reduce increases\n      in BMI, % body fat, and risk for onset of obesity during follow-up.\n      Secondary Aim: To test the hypothesis that Healthy Weight will significantly reduce body\n      dissatisfaction, depressive symptoms, and eating disorder symptoms.\n      NOTE: THIS STUDY IS ONLY OPEN TO PATIENTS AT THE MOUNT SINAI ADOLESCENT HEALTH CENTER\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Obesity is associated with increased risk of mortality, atherosclerotic cerebrovascular\n      disease, coronary heart disease, colorectal cancer and death from all causes (Flegal et al.,\n      2005), is credited with over 111,000 deaths annually in the US (Flegal et al., 2005),\n      shortens the lifespan by 5-20 years (Fontaine et al., 2003) and results in $150 billion in\n      annual health-related expenditures (Finkelstein et al., 2009). Despite alarming increases in\n      both adult and childhood obesity in recent decades, obesity rates in adolescents have grown\n      at an even faster rate (Ogden et al., 2012; NCHS, 2012). Adolescent obesity has more than\n      tripled in the past 30 years and continues to rise (Ogden et al., 2012; NCHS, 2012). Obese\n      adolescents are more likely to have high cholesterol and high blood pressure, prediabetes,\n      bone/joint problems, sleep apnea, and social and psychological problems such as\n      stigmatization and poor self-esteem (DHHS, 2010; CDC, 2011). Unfortunately, virtually all\n      obesity treatments result in only transient weight loss (Turk et al., 2009). Evidence\n      suggests that it is nearly impossible for individuals to maintain behavioral weight losses\n      once they have been obese for an extended period of time (Ochner et al., 2013). Although\n      bariatric surgery can result in more persistent weight loss, this invasive procedure is\n      contraindicated for numerous individuals, particularly children (Martin et al., 2010). Thus,\n      a pressing public health priority is to develop simple and effective obesity prevention\n      programs.\n      In 2010, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued recommendations for\n      screening and treating childhood and adolescent obesity. They endorsed comprehensive\n      moderate-to high intensity programs including counseling for weight loss, healthy diet, and\n      physical activity as well as instruction and support for the use of behavioral management\n      techniques including self-monitoring, stimulus control, eating management, contingency\n      management, and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. The USPSTF further defined\n      moderate- to high-intensity programs as > 25 hr of contact and states that \"such\n      interventions would not be feasible for implementation in a primary care setting.\" (USPSTF,\n      2010, p. 365). Further, they assert that less intensive (< 25 contact hours) programs do not\n      produce significant improvements. \"Low-intensity interventions, defined as < 25 contact\n      hours over a 6-month period, did not result in significant improvement in weight status\"\n      (USPSTF, 2010, p. 364). The implication is that, since most centers cannot provide this\n      level of service, it is not worthwhile for adolescent health centers to provide any kind of\n      obesity intervention at all. According to the USPSTF's website, \"its recommendations are\n      considered the gold standard for clinical preventive services.\" Such recommendations could\n      discourage the testing and implementation of brief interventions designed to prevent\n      obesity. Thus, to refute USPSTF statement, we propose to show that a 6-hr intervention led\n      by graduate students can produce significant reductions in risk for both obesity and eating\n      disorders, suggesting that this brief and inexpensive intervention could and should be\n      rolled out nationwide.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  \u2265 12 years old\n
