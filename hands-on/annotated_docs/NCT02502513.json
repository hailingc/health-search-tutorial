{"text": "TITLE:\n      Prevention of Intrusive Memories and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms After Emergency Cesarean Section\nSUMMARY:\n      This pilot study aims to investigate the effects of a brief computerized intervention (the\n      computer game \"Tetris\") on intrusive memories and other posttraumatic stress symptoms\n      following an emergency cesarean section. Patients who have undergone an emergency cesarian\n      section will be randomly allocated to either the brief computerized intervention or usual\n      care within the first 6 hours following the operation. Participants will be followed up at\n      one week and one month. It is predicted that participants given the brief computerized\n      intervention will develop fewer intrusive memories and less severe clinical symptoms than\n      those who are not. This will inform the potential future development of a simple\n      computerized intervention to prevent distressing psychological symptoms after a traumatic\n      event such as an emergency cesarean section.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Female, aged 18+ years\n          -  Had emergency caesarean section within the past 6 hours\n          -  Have given birth to a live baby at \u2265 37 weeks gestation\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Do not speak French sufficiently well to participate in assessments\n          -  Have established intellectual disability or psychotic illness\n          -  Baby was transferred to intensive care unit after the birth\n", "cuis": "C0558380 C0199176 C0700327 C1457887 C3854129 C1706867 C0038435 C0723460 C1552616 C1706244 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0947630 C0521991 C0700327 C0558380 C1321193 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C1552858 C0007876 C0015252 C0728940 C0184905 C0543467 C3244306 C0035110 C0949626 C0580931 C1561542 C3244317 C1561540 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0700327 C1457887 C1306232 C3272565 C2363670 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0700287 C0723323 C2222792 C0233397 C2232697 C2232698 C2045663 C2142990 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0231303 C0558380 C1321193 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C3840862 C0007876 C1384674 C0475172 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C1135241 C3244317 C0005615 C1550722 C3245487 C0243161 C1261322 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C0600116 C3714756 C0026106 C0033975 C0459435 C0221423 C0424228 C0085559 C0005615 C1550722 C3245487 ", "concepts": "Emergency Cesarean Section, Prevention, Memories, Symptom, Symptom, B-Symptoms, Stress, Stress summary, summary interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, study stress symptoms, memories emergency cesarean section, Born by emergency cesarean section, emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, section, C-section, resection, Resection, Bisection operation, operations, reoperation, Reoperation, care month, given, week interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, memories, symptoms, severed, Clinical, developer development, Development, Development, Development, No development, inform, simplet, OT potential psychological symptoms, psychological symptoms mood, psychological symptoms sleep, psychological symptoms energy, psychological symptoms sexual, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, distressing emergency cesarean section, Born by emergency cesarean section criteria, Eligibility Criteria 75+ years caesarean sections, Caesarean section, H/O: caesarean section, emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency weeks gestation, given, births, birth, birth Criteria assessment, Assessment, Assessment, Assessment, speak intellectual disability, Intellectual disability, mild, psychotic, Psychotic, illness, Stillness intensive care, births, birth, birth "}
