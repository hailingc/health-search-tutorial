{"text": "TITLE:\n      Study of Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine Serum Free Compared With Reference Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine in Healthy Adults\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to generate data in human on immunogenicity and safety of\n      Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine (VRVg) in support of the vaccine registration.\n      Primary Objective:\n        -  To demonstrate that VRVg is at least as immunogenic as the reference vaccine, Verorab,\n           in terms of seroconversion rate at Day 42 of the primary vaccination series.\n      Secondary Objectives:\n        -  To assess the clinical safety of VRVg after each vaccination when administered in a\n           pre-exposure vaccination schedule with a booster at 12 months after the first\n           vaccination in all subjects.\n        -  To describe the immune response induced by VRVg 21 days after two vaccinations in a\n           subset of randomized subjects and 14 days after the last vaccination of the primary\n           vaccination series.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      All subjects will receive three vaccinations for primary series and a booster vaccination at\n      12 months after the first vaccination.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria :\n          -  Aged 18 to 60 years on the day of inclusion\n          -  Provision of a signed Informed Consent Form\n          -  Able

contraception or abstinence for at least 4 weeks prior to each vaccination,\n             until at least 4 weeks after each vaccination)\n          -  Entitlement to national social security\n        Exclusion Criteria :\n          -  For a woman of child-bearing potential, known pregnancy or positive urine pregnancy\n             test\n          -  Breast-feeding woman\n          -  Participation in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical\n             device, or a medical procedure in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination\n          -  Planned participation in another clinical trial during the present trial period\n          -  Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, immunosuppressive therapy\n             such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months,\n             or long-term systemic corticosteroids therapy\n          -  Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components or history of a\n             life-threatening reaction to the trial vaccine or to a vaccine containing any of the\n             same substances\n          -  Chronic illness, at a stage that could interfere with trial conduct or completion, in\n             the opinion of the Investigator\n          -  Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction that may interfere with the subject's ability\n             to comply with trial procedures\n          -  Receipt of blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months, that might interfere\n             with the assessment of immune response\n          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination\n          -  Planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following any trial vaccination\n

or post-exposure\n             regimen)\n          -  Thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorder or anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding\n             inclusion contraindicating intramuscular (IM) vaccination\n          -  Subject at high risk for rabies exposure during the trial period\n          -  Subjects deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency\n             setting, or hospitalized without his/her consent\n          -  Febrile illness (temperature \u226538.0\u00b0C) or moderate or severe acute illness/infection\n             on the day of vaccination,
