rabies immune globulin (HRIG) or placebo\n      in combination with rabies vaccine in healthy adult subjects.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Subjects free of obvious health-problems or with stable condition\n          -  Male or female subjects aged \u226519 to \u226465 years\n          -  BMI between \u226518 and \u226430 kg/m2\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Prior history of active or passive rabies immunization\n          -  Clinically significant acute illness or infection within 2 weeks before first dosing\n             based on the clinical judgment of the investigator\n          -  History and/or family history of clinically significant immunodeficiency or\n             auto-immune disease\n          -  Any clinically significant history of known or suspected anaphylaxis or\n             hypersensitivity reaction\n          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 6\n             months before the first dose of investigational medicinal product\n", "cuis": "C0034496 C3811910 C3539181 C3539182 C3539954 C3539955 C3539956 C3539957 C3539959 C3539960 C3539961 C3539962 C3539963
