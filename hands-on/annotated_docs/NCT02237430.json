{"text": "TITLE:\n      Randomized Comparison of MynxGrip Vascular Closure Device and Manual Compression for Closure After Femoral Access Angiography. The Closure Devices Used in Every Day Practice Study, CLOSE-UP III Trial\nSUMMARY:\n      Is the MynxGrip (test device) non-inferior to manuel compression (standard comparator) in\n      the incidence of adverse access site related events in-hospital, at 30 days and at 6 months.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Prospective, randomized (1:1), controlled, non-blinded, single center study in 2000 patients\n      comparing the MynxGrip (test device) and manuel compression (standard comparator). Safety\n      and efficacy endpoints will be reported for in-hospital, 30 days and 6 months.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  >18 year\n          -  Should be able to provide valid informed signed consent\n          -  CAG, possibly including intracoronary measurement (FFR) or intracoronary imaging\n             (IVUS, optical coherence tomography (OCT), NIRS)\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure and/or implantation of stents\n          -  ST-Elevations Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)\n          -  Multiple punctures\n          -  Active infection\n          -  Groin haematoma before the closure procedure\n          -  Known pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous (AV) fistula in the ipsilateral groin\n          -  Cardiogenic shock\n          -  Prior peripheral arterial surgery in abdomen or lower extremities\n          -  Sheat size >7 F\n          -  Life expectancy less than one year\n          -  Possible pregnancy or positive pregnancy test or breastfeeding women\n          -  Simultaneous or planned subsequent femoral vein access\n          -  Allergy to any of the components in the closure material left in the groin\n          -  Puncture or closure with closure device at same site < 30 days\n          -  Puncture or closure with manuel compression at same site < 5 days\n          -  Patients with peripheral artery disease can be included at operators discretion\n             except if heavy calcification is present at the access site, which at the operators\n             discretion precludes insertion of the closure device\n", "cuis": "C3504161 C0565514 C4049863 C0002978 C0237607 C3245512 C0185003 C0015811 C3887560 C0025080 C0024763 C3891067 C0947630 C3897779 C1966209 C1552616 C1706244 C0565514 C0021153 C1829459 C4049863 C0392366 C0456984 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0233492 C0445356 C3842337 C1561542 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0087136 C0723338 C0947630 C0180112 C2911690 C0565514 C0021153 C1829459 C4049863 C0392366 C0456984 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0700287 C1549114 C0684224 C3842337 C1561542 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1561543 C1561610 C2090600 C1299581 C1555587 C0562357 C0079595 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C0920367 C3836578 C2013355 C3836581 C3665728 C3665899 C2013322 C1271441 C0243161 C1532338 C4049682 C4049683 C4034923 C4049680 C4049681 C1532297 C1320647 C4037588 C0021107 C0029976 C0035139 C0395094 C1293232 C1293492 C1293725 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0038257 C0183875 C1705817 C0027051 C0428953 C3810814 C0155668 C3640911 C0155626 C3541950 C3829910 C2348362 C0340324 C2926063 C0439775 C0033119 C0034117 C0009450 C3714514 C0275524 C0012683 C0035637 C0276041 C0729555 C0747002 C0718247 C0585249 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0162868 C1510412 C0018246 C0036980 C0023216 C0230420 C0226813 C0239340 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0000726 C0230168 C0489868 C0190961 C0009653 C0227952 C1561543 C0240802 C0151865 C0430066 C2584394 C0430059 C0425965 C0006147 C1623040 C1623041 C0015809 C0020517 C0718579 C1527304 C3539909 C0018246 C0033119 C0034117 C3842337 C3504161 C0565514 C0021153 C1829459 C4049863 C0033119 C0034117 C0489868 C0012634 C0018609 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0006663 C0374082 C0700185 C1551379 C2242558 C0333581 C0441587 C0035139 ", "concepts": "Vascular Closure Device, Compression, Impression, Angiography, Practice, practice, Closure, Femoral, Devices, Device, Manual, Manual, Study, Randomiz, Triall summary, summary compression, decompression, Decompression, Impression, test, test, standards, Standard, Standard elated, Unrelated, 0 days, month description, prescription, prescription single, singlet, study, controllers, Controlled compression, decompression, Decompression, Impression, test, test, standards, Standard, Standard Reported, Unreported, Reported, 0 days, month criteria, Eligibility Criteria year signed, signed:, able, provider, Uninformed imaging, ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement OCT -
