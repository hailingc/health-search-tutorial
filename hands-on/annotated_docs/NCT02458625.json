{"text": "TITLE:\n      A Comparison Between Intravenous Iron Sucrose to Its Combination With Oral Iron Supplements for the Treatment of Postpartum Anemia\nSUMMARY:\n      This study is aimed to compare the efficacy of two mode of iron administration to treat post\n      partum anemia - a single dose of intravenous iron sucrose versus a single dose of iron\n      sucrose and 6 weeks of treatment with oral iron supplement.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Anemia is common following delivery. It is associated with disturbing symptoms such as\n      fatigue, cognitive impairment and syncope in severe cases. International guidelines\n      recommend to use intravenous iron sucrose to treat intermediate and severe anemia until the\n      target hemoglobin is achieved. However, patient's compliance after delivery is low, making\n      the administration of several doses difficult. In those cases oral iron supplements might be\n      used. In the present study the investigators will compare the efficacy of two iron\n      administration protocols to treat post partum anemia - a single dose of intravenous iron\n      sucrose versus a single dose of iron sucrose and 6 weeks of treatment with oral iron\n      supplement.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Women above 18 years old after giving birth\n          -  Women who suffer from iron deficiency anemia, defined as hemoglobin< 10 g/dl without\n             one of the conditions that are described in the exclusion criteria\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Women who suffer from known allergy for iron supplements\n          -  Women who suffer from anemia not due to iron deficiency\n          -  Women who suffer from acute infection\n          -  Women who suffer from liver failure or viral hepatitis\n          -  Women who suffer from thalassemia or hemoglobinopathies\n          -  Women who suffer from renal failure\n          -  Women who suffer from unbalanced thyroid disorder\n", "cuis": "C0060241 C3811910 C3539181 C3539182 C3539954 C3539955 C3539956 C3539957 C3539959 C3539960 C3539961 C3539962 C3539963 C3539964 C3539965 C3539966 C3539967 C3539968 C3539969 C3539970 C3539971 C3539972 C3539973 C3539974 C3539975 C3539976 C3539977 C3539978 C3539979 C3540026 C3540027 C3540028 C3540030 C3540031 C3540719 C3540720 C3540721 C3540722 C3540723 C3540724 C3540740 C3854036 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0002871 C0302583 C0337439 C1947943 C0085297 C1552616 C1706244 C1533734 C0376495 C0199808 C0199810 C0725057 C1536282 C0001563 C0036589 C0150270 C3469597 C0947630 C0302583 C1166521 C0060241 C0002871 C0087136 C0723338 C0302583 C1166521 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0038636 C1161331 C0302583 C1166521 C1947943 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0011209 C2053584 C0308779 C1390948 C1314680 C1457887 C0002871 C3245511 C0338656 C1270972 C3554639 C0162791 C0220845 C0282423 C0015672 C2024893 C0039070 C1306232 C0238644 C0060241 C1550465 C2827755 C3841550 C0518015 C0948093 C2216252 C1561562 C2239101 C0019034 C0546660 C1168591 C1168592 C0037054 C0011209 C2053584 C0308779 C1390948 C1314680 C1550472 C3714738 C0376405 C1533734 C0376495 C0199808 C0199810 C0725057 C1536282 C0001563 C0036589 C0150270 C3469597 C0302583 C1166521 C1299586 C1947943 C0947630 C0302583 C1166521 C1533734 C0376495 C0199808 C0199810 C0725057 C1536282 C0001563 C0036589 C0150270 C3469597 C0442711 C1507394 C0002871 C0087136 C0723338 C0302583 C1166521 C0060241 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0038636 C1161331 C0087136 C0723338 C0302583 C1166521 C1947943 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0005615 C0162316 C0041782 C0477300 C0740989 C0272062 C0518015 C0948093 C2216252 C1561562 C2239101 C0019034 C0546660 C1168591 C1168592 C0037054 C0683278 C0243161 C0012634 C0243161 C0020517 C0489531 C1527304 C0719113 C0719656 C3247823 C0683278 C0302583 C1166521 C3845898 C1947943 C0162316 C0240066 C0683278 C0002871 C0275518 C0275519 C0683278 C0042721 C0019163 C0019196 C1963279 C0011226 C0019159 C0085293 C0276442 C1112306 C0085605 C0683278 C0019045 C0029632 C0852325 C0039730 C0005283 C0271985 C0683278 C0035078 C0001623 C1963154 C3267129 C3810103 C1167727 C0683278 C0040128 C0030517 C0455487 C0683278 C1737826 ", "concepts": "Iron Sucrose, Combination, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, combinations, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Anemia, Iron, Iron, Supplement, Intravenous IG summary, summary administration, Readministration, Dpt administration, Mmr administration, administration sets, Maladministrations, oral administration, self administration, Drug administration, drug administration, study, iron, iron iron sucrose, anemia, single, singlet, iron, iron Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, sucrose, sucrose, iron, iron, Supplement description, prescription, prescription Delivery, delivery, deliver, c.delivery, Delivery, symptoms, Anemia, common cognitive impairment, Mild cognitive impairment, Severe cognitive impairment, Guidelines, guidelines, guideline, fatigued, fatigue, syncope, severed severe anemia, iron sucrose, Intermediate, Intermediate, EMT-intermediate Haemoglobin, hemoglobins s, hemoglobin D, Hemoglobin, Hemoglobin, hemoglobin sc, Methemoglobin, Oxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, hemoglobin;
