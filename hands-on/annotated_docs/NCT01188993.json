{"text": "TITLE:\n      Transpulmonary Thermodilution and Transesophageal Echocardiography in Early Septic Shock\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to assess the concordance of therapeutic changes proposed after\n      an early hemodynamic evaluation (hemodynamic profile) in septic shock patients using jointly\n      the transpulmonary thermodilution technique and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Each patient will be assessed by both the transpulmonary thermodilution technique and TEE\n      (H0). The two assessments will be performed in random order (central randomization\n      stratified by participating center), but within 30 minutes (no change of ongoing treatment\n      during the assessment period). Two investigators not involved in patient care and blinded to\n      the results of the alternative technique will performed independently the hemodynamic\n      assessment using one of the two modalities for hemodynamic assessment tested in the study.\n      They will interpret the results at bedside and propose a therapeutic change to the attending\n      physician, according to the hemodynamic profile. The latter will finally: precisely identify\n      the clinical problem to be solved (e.g., therapeutic target of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign\n      not reached, tissue hypoperfusion), choose a therapy adapted while taking into account the\n      clinical scenario and the results of both the transpulmonary thermodilution and TEE,\n      evaluate the efficacy of this treatment (problem solved or not) and its tolerance (potential\n      side-effect attributable to the treatment). In addition, the presence or resolution of signs\n      of tissue hypoperfusion will systematically be assessed at H6, H12 and H24. Primary and\n      secondary outcomes will be assessed by an independent committee of experts.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  ventilated patient in sinus rhythm with septic shock requiring a hemodynamic\n             assessment\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  < 18 yr-old\n          -  pregnancy\n          -  contra-indication for TEE, non sinus rhythm, aplasia, prior participation to the\n             study, hemodynamic assessment using any other technique than those tested in the\n             study.\n", "cuis": "C0206054 C0039807 C0036983 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C0036983 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0206054 C2022191 C4041033 C0039807 C0025664 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0039807 C0025664 C1261322 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1522411 C3244315 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C3845578 C0017313 C3853617 C0019993 C0002423 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C0025344 C0025664 C1299583 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C0392366 C0228018 C0947630 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C0804815 C3858576 C0033213 C2081614 C0036690 C0243026 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C3272565 C0442856 C0087111 C0033972 C2981730 C0039807 C3272565 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0220929 C0231197 C0231199 C1547317 C1744706 C0013220 C0020963 C0033213 C2081614 C0220825 C2222792 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0392148 C0596130 C1514893 C0442856 C0439631 C1299583 C0599749 C0011546 C0439857 C0027627 C1171947 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1299448 C0232201 C2041122 C0036983 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C0243161 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0232201 C2041122 C0243065 C0002793 C1301624 C0031809 C1261322 C0220825 C0870300 C1319010 C0392366 C0228018 C0947630 C0025664 C0947630 ", "concepts": "Transesophageal Echocardiography, Thermodilution, Septic Shock summary, summary study, Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic septic shock, Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation TOE - Transesophageal echocardiography, transesophageal 2-D echocardiography, Doppler transesophageal echocardiography, thermodilution, techniques description, prescription, prescription thermodilution, techniques assessment, Assessment, Assessment, Assessment, Border, orders Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, 16-30 minutes patient care, patient care, Inpatient care, outpatient care, Assessment, assessments, Assessment, Assessment, IQ assessment, period techniques, independent Assessment, assessments, Assessment, Assessment, IQ assessment, tested, teste, study Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic Physician, deidentify problem, problem:, Sepsis, Sepsis, Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic, Clinical hypoperfusion, therapy, Cotherapy, account thermodilution, Clinical Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, Tolerance, Tolerance, intolerances, Intolerance, intolerance, Tolerance, Tolerance, problem, problem:, Evaluate, OT potential Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, presence, Attributable, Resolution hypoperfusion, Primary independent, independency, dependency, dependence, secondary, committed criteria, Eligibility Criteria ventilated patient, Sinus rhythm, sinus rhythm, septic shock Assessment, assessments, Assessment, Assessment, IQ assessment Criteria pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy Sinus rhythm, sinus rhythm, aplasia, Anaplasia, contraindication Assessment, assessments, Assessment, Assessment, IQ assessment, tested, teste, study, techniques study "}
