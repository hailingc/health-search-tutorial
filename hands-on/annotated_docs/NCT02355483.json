{"text": "TITLE:\n      Impact of Unenhanced Computed Tomography (CT) in Elderly Patients Admitted to the Emergency Department With Acute Abdominal Pain\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to determine whether non-contrast abdominal computed tomography\n      (CT) impacts management (diagnosis, need for surgery and treatment) in elderly patients\n      admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      A systematic unenhanced abdominal CT is performed in elderly patients admitted to the\n      emergency patients with acute abdominal symptoms. Accuracy of unenhanced CT is assessed by\n      comparing diagnosis and therapeutic management recorded before and after unenhanced CT\n      versus gold standard diagnosis and management. Gold standard diagnosis and management are\n      established at 3 month follow up, based on patient's medical records and a systematic\n      telephone interview.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Elderly patients admitted to the emergency department (aged 75 year old and older)\n          -  acute abdominal pain\n          -  informed consent\n        Exclusion criteria:\n          -  traumatic pain\n          -  symptom duration of more than a week\n          -  unability for the patient to give informed consent\n", "cuis": "C0040405 C2717955 C0860888 C1956110 C0000737 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0809949 C0184666 C1547229 C1547295 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0040405 C0412643 C2181323 C0008794 C0860888 C0000726 C0000737 C0947630 C0449900 C1507248 C0009924 C0376636 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0000737 C0423651 C0235299 C0238551 C0238552 C0694551 C0277969 C0423646 C0581869 C2199213 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0184666 C0809949 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0000726 C0000737 C0184666 C0809949 C0740651 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0376636 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C0182913 C0376636 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0018026 C0337451 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0025102 C0551625 C1554096 C0746463 C1561542 C0935630 C1576871 C1626258 C3273808 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0184666 C0809949 C1561543 C1555709 C1948032 C0740577 C0009797 C0243161 C0030193 C1457887 C1561540 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C0009797 ", "concepts": "Xray Computed Tomography, 4D Computed Tomography, Spiral Computed Tomography, Volume Computed Tomography, Abdominal Pain, Emergency, Emergency, emergency, emergency, Emergency OB, Admitted, admitted, Acute, Acute, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary computerized tomography, computed tomography of hip, computed tomography of arm, cine computed tomography, computed tomography spiral, abdominal, abdominalgia, study, contrasted, W contrast, Contrast management, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, surgery, surgery, surgery: abdominal pain, No abdominal pain, RUQ abdominal pain, LLQ abdominal pain, LUQ abdominal pain, RLQ abdominal pain, back abdominal pain, abdominal pain site, abdominal pain wall, dull abdominal pain, emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, admitted, Admitted description, prescription, prescription abdominal, abdominalgia, admitted, Admitted abdominal symptoms, emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency management, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic, recorder management, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, Gold, Gold, standards, Standard, Standard medical recording, Medical records, Medical records, lost medical records, month interview, Telephone, Telephone, Telephone criteria, Eligibility Criteria emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, admitted, Admitted, year, folder, Folder acute abdominal pain informed consent form criteria pain symptom, week, Induration, Duration, Duration informed consent form "}
