{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effects of Intensive Robot-assisted Therapy in Patients With Subacute Stroke\nSUMMARY:\n      Robot-assisted training (RT) devices developed to date have a significant impact on stroke\n      rehabilitation. Several research groups have developed the robotic devices and examined\n      their efficacy on improving upper limb function after stroke. All these robotic devices have\n      been applied in stroke rehabilitation and their efficacy are evaluated, but the scientific\n      evidence for the mechanisms of RT-induced recovery, the optimal treatment intensity, and the\n      impact on physiological responses is still lacking.\n      This trial is to examine (1) the immediate effects of treatment intensity in RT on\n      sensorimotor impairments and functional performance in patients with subacute stroke; (2)\n      the long-term benefits of treatment intensity in RT by conducting a 6-month follow up\n      evaluation; and (3) the effects of RT on cortical/movement reorganization as well as on the\n      physiological markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and erythrocyte deformability.\n      These overall findings will help better understanding of the efficacy of RT on functional\n      outcomes, brain and movement reorganization, and physiological markers.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Subacute stroke participants will be recruited from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and\n      then were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: RT with higher-intensity group, RT with\n      lower-intensity group, and conventional intervention group. Assessments on sensorimotor\n      impairments (Fugl Mayer Assessment, Motor Status Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale, Myoton,\n      Muscle Metabolism, Box and Block Test, and Revised Nottingham Sensory assessment) and\n      functional performance (Functional Independence Measure, Motor Activity Log, ABILHAND\n      Questionnaire, Adelaide Activities Profile, EQ-5D-5L, and accelerometer) take about 40\n      minutes to complete. Evaluation of brain reorganization using functional magnetic resonance\n      image and movement patterns by kinematic analysis take about 1 hour for each examination.\n      Blood samples of the patients (12 ml.) will be collected to examine the physiological\n      markers (ie, inflammation-related markers, oxidative stress markers, and erythrocyte\n      deformability) before and after intervention. Total 24 ml blood will be collected in this\n      study. Except for the blood taking, all the examinations are non-invasive.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  first episode of unilateral stroke\n          -  time since stroke less than 3 months, i.e., acute or subacute stage\n          -  initial motor part of upper limb of FMA score ranging from 10 to 40, indicating\n             severe to moderate movement impairment\n          -  no serious cognitive impairment (i.e., Mini Mental State Exam score > 23)\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  pregnant or breastfeeding women\n          -  aphasia that might interfere with understanding instructions\n          -  major health problems or poor physical conditions that might limit participation\n          -  currently participation in any other research. Potential participants will be also\n             excluded if they have any contraindication to fMRI scanning including claustrophobia,\n             seizures, the presence of pacemaker, mental elements (e.g., steel nails) inside the\n             body or in the eyes, and excessive obesity.\n", "cuis": "C0087111 C1363945 C1510538 C0038454 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840
