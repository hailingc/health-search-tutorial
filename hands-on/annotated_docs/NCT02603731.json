{"text": "TITLE:\n      Delirium at the Intensive Care Unit - a Retrospective Cohort Study\nSUMMARY:\n      This project seeks to describe the incidence of delirium in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)\n      and to identify risk and preventive factors associated with development of delirium.\n      Especially, the investigators want to investigate if an imitated natural light/dark cycle\n      influences frequency of delirium.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      A common problem for patients in the ICU is episodes of delirium. Recent trials have\n      described incidences ranging from 60-87% of patients in a number of different countries.\n      Delirium is a condition with fluctuating conscience, disorganized thinking and disturbance\n      of the sleep/wake cycle. Many patients with delirium experience hallucinations and agitation\n      which can be very unpleasant for both patients and their families.\n      Some risk factors for the development of delirium well known, e.g. dementia, hypertension,\n      illness severity (SAPS II score), delirium on the previous day, mechanical ventilation,\n      emergency surgery and metabolic acidosis. The effect of sedative drug administration is not\n      clear, as studies has been inconclusive.\n      Even though studies regarding the impact of sleep deprivation on development of delirium\n      have been inconclusive, there is no doubt that delirious patients have a disturbed\n      sleep-wake cycle, sleep architecture and circadian rhythm.\n      At the intensive care unit at the Department of Anesthesiology at K\u00f8ge Hospital, three out\n      of nine rooms have a simulated circadian light installed. The idea is that this light rhythm\n      may help to keep a natural circadian rhythm, minimizing the risk of delirium.\n      With this descriptive and retrospective cohort study, the investigators therefore want to\n      describe the incidence and possible risk- and preventive factors of delirium for the\n      participants (ICU patients at K\u00f8ge Hospital), and with a special focus on the possible\n      effect of imitated circadian light..\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients >18 years of age admitted to the ICU at K\u00f8ge Hospital in the study period\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS): -4 or -5 during the whole study period\n          -  No CAM-ICU scores during the ICU stay\n          -  Unable to communicate in Danish (aphasic, deaf, non-Danish speaking, severe brain\n             damage)\n          -  Severe dementia documented in electronic patient charts (OPUS)\n          -  Patients not receiving active treatment (moribund patients)\n", "cuis": "C0085559 C0011206 C0947630 C2347274 C1552616 C1706244 C0085559 C0011206 C2347274 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0011206 C3858576 C0275586 C4050469 C0056685 C0011206 C2347273 C3898838 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0011206 C0033213 C2081614 C3245511 C0009790 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0011206 C0039869 C0018524 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0085631 C1963060 C0011206 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C0442696 C0056685 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0011206 C0011265 C0497327 C3845898 C0199470 C2223989 C3836859 C0042497 C2223988 C2228926 C2223979 C0011206 C0221423 C0424228 C1561538 C2983285 C3469597 C0150270 C1533734 C0220981 C1860088 C0161976 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0020592 C0036557 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0947630 C0037316 C0751506 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0011206 C0947630 C0011206 C0870444 C0008810 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C0442696 C0056685 C0085559 C1369616 C0871269 C1523018 C0275586 C4050469 C0008810 C0011206 C1552861 C0947630 C0678257 C0011206 C0701928 C0275586 C4050469 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0184666 C0809949 C0025344 C0947630 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0243161 C0085631 C1963060 C0235195 C0344106 C0025344 C4050231 C0947630 C0566000 C2364293 C0234461 C0006104 C1306232 C0010957 C3494652 C1301725 C1609436 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C0684240 C0007963 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1320102 C0424547 C1547299 ", "concepts": "Intensive Care, Delirium, Study, Unit summary, summary Intensive Care, delirium, Unit development, Development, Development, Development, No development, delirium, deidentify blight, Slight, cyclen delirium, Frequency, Frequency description, prescription, prescription delirium, problem, problem:, common conscience, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, Delirium, thinking hallucinations, experience, experience, Inexperience, agitation, Agitation, delirium, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, wake, cyclen risk factors, risk factors, No risk factors, A/N risk factors, hypertension, Hypertension, Prehypertensions, No hypertension, hypertensin, development, Development, Development, Development, No development, delirium, dementia, dementia, Uknown Mechanical ventilation, NOS, mechanical ventilation rate, mechanical ventilation care, mechanical ventilators, mechanical ventilation volume, mechanical ventilation weaning, mode of mechanical ventilation, delirium, illness, Stillness, day, Severity Drug administration, Drug administration, administration, Metabolic acidosis NOS, Mild metabolic acidosis, Metabolic acidosis NEC, emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, sedative, sedative, surgery, surgery, surgery: studies rndx sleep deprivation, rem sleep deprivation, development, Development, Development, Development, No development, delirium, studies delirious, doubt circadian rhythm, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, wake, cyclen intensive care, Anesthesiology Note rhythms, rhythm, blight, Slight circadian rhythm, delirium, help study, Descriptive delirium special k blight, Slight criteria, Eligibility Criteria admitted, Admitted, period, study, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient Criteria agitation, Agitation, sedation, sedation, period, Score, study Unable to communicate, able to communicate, aphasic, brain, severed damage Severe dementia, Documented, Documented, document, document, document, charts, chart Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Factive, Moribund, Moribund "}
