Many COPD patients\n      have reduced exercise capacity, The investigators hypothesized that acute nitrate\n      consumption, in the form of beetroot juice, might increase incremental shuttle walk test\n      (ISWT) distance in COPD subjects.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Acute consumption of dietary nitrate (as beetroot juice) has been shown to improve exercise\n      capacity in athletes, healthy adults and subjects with peripheral vascular disease. Many\n      COPD patients have reduced exercise capacity, The investigators hypothesized that acute\n      nitrate consumption might increase incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) distance in COPD\n      subjects compared to a matched, low-nitrate drink.\n      This study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover trial.\n      Resting blood pressure, phlebotomy and ISWT are performed. Following completion, each\n      subject is randomized to consume beetroot juice or placebo. 3 hours later, the same\n      assessments are repeated by the same people. After a 7d washout, the entire protocol is\n      repeated with the crossover beverage.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Information consenting out-patients with a previous physician diagnosis of COPD\n          -  Clinically stable\n          -  Ambulatory\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Subjects who required supplemental oxygen for exercise\n          -  Subjects with pulmonary hypertension and angina\n          -  Intolerant to beetroot\n          -  Insulin dependent diabetes\n          -  Thyroid disease\n", "cuis": "C1552616 C1706244 C0452240 C1522704 C1947907 C4071751 C0085096 C0553983 C0162819 C0199686 C0011871 C3698278 C0686750 C0452240 C1522704 C0392366 C0456984 C1947907 C4071751 C0043094 C0557899 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C1547229 C1547295 C0452240 C1522704 C1947907 C4071751 C0085096 C0553983 C0162819 C0199686 C0011871 C3698278 C0686750 C0452240 C1522704 C0392366 C0456984 C1947907 C4071751 C0043094 C0557899 C1550472 C0032042 C0947630 C0456909 C0180112 C2911690 C0018792 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0020649 C0725357 C2230142 C0020538 C2926615 C0180208 C0428889 C0428886 C0488053 C0497247 C0190979 C0684257 C2183248 C3272109 C0031555 C0032042 C3273186 C1261322 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1561528 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0804815 C3272565 C1547135 C1561560 C0243161 C3245501 C3245502 C1619636 C0030054 C0184633 C0452240 C1522704 C2037435 C0020542 C1963220 C1868851 C0152171 C3203102 C3807623 C0002962 C2024883 C0231199 C1547317 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0021641 C0202098 C1533581 C1579433 C2739803 C3537244 C1299583 C0040128 C2186538 C0455366 ", "concepts": "summary, summary exercises, Exercise, Consumption, O2 consumption PVD - Peripheral vascular disease, Other peripheral vascular diseases, peripheral vascular disease of skin, Peripheral vascular disease study, Diabetic peripheral vascular disease, Secondary peripheral vascular disease, healthy adult exercises, Exercise test, test, Consumption, O2 consumption, weight increase, Height increased description, prescription, prescription Acute, Acute, exercises, Exercise, Consumption, O2 consumption PVD - Peripheral vascular disease, Other peripheral vascular diseases, peripheral vascular disease of skin, Peripheral vascular disease study, Diabetic peripheral vascular disease, Secondary peripheral vascular disease, healthy adult exercises, Exercise test, test, Consumption, O2 consumption, weight increase, Height increased low placebo, study, blind, controllers, Controlled, Atrial Blood pressure, take blood pressure, blood pressures, low blood pressures, blood pressure kit, blood pressure leg, high blood pressure, High blood pressure, blood pressure cuff, Cuff blood pressure, mean blood pressure, Mean blood pressure, blood pressure rise, Phlebotomy, Phlebotomy, phlebotomy, phlebotomy, Phlebotomy placebo, consumer assessment, Assessment, Assessment, Assessment, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol criteria, Eligibility Criteria Information, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, Physician Clinical Ambulatory, ambulatory Criteria required, required, Required, oxygen, oxygen, exercises, Exercise, supplemental HPI Pulmonary hypertension, NOS, Pulmonary hypertension, Portopulmonary hypertension, pulmonary primary hypertension, Primary pulmonary hypertension, Pulmonary hypertension, mild, anginas, angina Intolerance, Intolerance Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes, Insulin, Insulin, Insulin, Insulin, Insulin, Insulins, Independent thyroid diseases, thyroid disease, FH: Thyroid disease "}
