{"text": "TITLE:\n      Kappa Opioid Receptor Imaging in Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\nSUMMARY:\n      This study uses positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to measure kappa opioid receptors\n      (KOR) in the brains of individuals with and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n      The investigators propose to recruit 45 drug-na\u00efve individuals, N=15 patients with PTSD,\n      N=15 trauma-exposed, but asymptomatic healthy control subjects (TC) and N=15 non-trauma\n      exposed healthy control subjects (HC) to participate in one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n      and one PET study. The investigators will also carefully document trauma history, and\n      collect behavioral and neuroendocrine measures to provide a more integrative view on the\n      neurobiology of PTSD and its phenotype. The investigators predict PTSD will show greater\n      carbon - 11 (11C)[11C]LY2795050 volume of distribution (VT) (i.e. KOR binding) values than\n      control populations in an a priori defined PTSD circuit.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion criteria for patients with PTSD:\n          1. age 18-55 years old\n          2. currently diagnosed with PTSD and symptomatic with a Clinician-Administered PTSD\n             Scale (CAPS) score > 50.\n        Exclusion criteria for patients with PTSD:\n          1. any primary Axis I disorder other than PTSD (e.g. psychosis)\n          2. medical or neurological illnesses likely to affect physiology or anatomy, i.e.\n             uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disorders\n          3. a history of drug (including benzodiazepines (BZD)) dependence (Diagnostic and\n             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV) criteria) within 1 year of the study\n             and lasting longer than 2 years, except for alcohol dependence\n          4. current pregnancy (as documented by pregnancy testing at screening or on the day of\n             PET imaging study)\n          5. current breast feeding\n          6. use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5\n             cigarettes per day, or cannot abstain from smoking during the prescribed tests\n          7. acute suicidal ideation or behavior, as defined by suicidal ideation and behavior\n             during the 3-month period prior to enrollment in the study and while being enrolled\n             in the study\n          8. general MRI exclusion criteria, i.e. pacemakers, metals in the body\n          9.
