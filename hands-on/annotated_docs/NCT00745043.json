{"text": "TITLE:\n      Beta-Blocker in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Study\nSUMMARY:\n      Smoking causes both smoking related lung disease (COPD) and ischaemic heart disease. These\n      are very common conditions and many patients have both diseases. Beta-blocker drugs are\n      extensively used in the treatment of angina, high blood pressure and after heart attacks to\n      decrease symptoms and prolong life. Beta-agonists are used in COPD to decrease\n      breathlessness and improve exercise tolerance. It used to be thought that beta-blockers\n      cannot be used in COPD patients as they may make the breathlessness worse, but it has now\n      been established that they can be used safely. Beta-blocker drugs and beta-agonists have\n      'opposite' effects on the body and the investigators do not know if they can work together\n      or if they would cancel each other out. The investigators also do not know which of the\n      different types of beta-blockers now available are better for COPD patients. This study will\n      investigate what happens to the airways of people taking both of these drugs.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Clinical diagnosis of COPD\n          -  > 40 years of age\n          -  > 15 pack year smoking history\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Contra-indication to beta-blocker use\n          -  Severe COPD FEV1 < 30% or 1 L\n          -  Not responsive the methacholine\n", "cuis": "C0024117 C0600260 C0947630 C0439096 C1552616 C1706244 C0010054 C0151744 C1313980 C1510446 C0264694 C0848343 C0024115 C2316532 C1548578 C0233492 C0445356 C0001645 C0012634 C3245511 C0013227 C0020538 C2926615 C0857121 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0027051 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0002962 C2024883 C1457887 C0243192 C2987634 C0439096 C0162521 C2024889 C2709256 C0015260 C3149603 C0424551 C0013404 C0425446 C0001645 C0013404 C0425446 C1457868 C0001645 C0243192 C2987634 C0013227 C0152338 C0947630 C0001645 C0178987 C0458827 C2096027 C0013227 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C3272565 C1277691 C0262926 C2004062 C0243161 C0001645 C3883383 C1547227 C1547231 C1561581 C4050465 C4050466 C0264097 C0600370 C0237284 ", "concepts": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Study, Beta summary, summary ischaemic heart disease, Ischemic heart disease, FH: Ischaemic heart disease, Acute ischaemic heart disease, Chronic ischaemic heart disease, Subacute ischaemic heart disease, lung disease, FH: lung disease, Smoking, elated, Unrelated Beta-blocker, condition, common, drugs high; blood pressure, High blood pressure, with high blood pressure, blood pressure, blood pressure, blood pressure, heart attacks, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, anginas, angina symptoms, agonists, agonist, Beta Exercise tolerance, exercise tolerance, Exercise tolerance, exercise tolerance test, Poor exercise tolerance, exercise intolerance, breathlessness, No breathlessness, beta-blocker breathlessness, No breathlessness, worse Beta-blocker, agonists, agonist, drugs body study, beta-blocker airway, airway, airway, drugs criteria, Eligibility Criteria diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, Clinical pack year, history, history Criteria beta-blocker, EContra Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Severe, Sever methacholine, Unresponsive "}
