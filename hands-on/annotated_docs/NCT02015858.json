{"text": "TITLE:\n      Pain During Chest Tube Withdrawal: Evaluation Using Pan Monitor\nSUMMARY:\n      Pain evaluation remains a clinical problem. Pain Monitor allows pain evaluation using the\n      measurement of skin conductance.\n      Withdrawal of chest tube can be painful and the purpose of the study was to compare\n      auto-evaluation of pain (visual analogic scale) and the index measured by the Pain Monitor.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  patients undergoing removal of a chest tube after lung surgery,\n          -  patients able to indicate the pain score.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  pregnancy, lactation ,\n          -  insulin-dependent diabetes with dysautonomia,\n          -  central or peripheral neurological disease, agitation,\n          -  inability to understand the protocol,\n          -  inability to use the Pain Monitor: skin abnormalities at the site of measurement,\n             pacemaker or implantable defibrillator, condition affecting the sympathetic nervous\n             system, tremor of the extremities,\n          -  contra-indication to oral morphine ,\n          -  respiratory failure, severe hepatic insufficiency, intracranial hypertension,\n             epilepsy associations\n          -  recent administration of neostigmine or of atropine.\n", "cuis": "C0008034 C1549530 C1550230 C2825032 C3812880 C4049634 C0220825 C1261322 C0181904 C0596972 C0030193 C1882272 C2598155 C1552616 C1706244 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0033213 C2081614 C0181904 C0596972 C0030193 C1882272 C2598155 C3272565 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C2825032 C3812880 C4049634 C0008034 C0030193 C0947630 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0181904 C0596972 C0175659 C0349674 C0237849 C0684254 C0918012 C0770655 C0030193 C1882272 C2598155 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0038903 C0008034 C0015252 C0728940 C0582148 C1299581 C0243161 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0043084 C0006147 C0013363 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0021641 C3537244 C1299583 C0027765 C0042075 C0752235 C0085631 C1963060 C0162340 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0037268 C0181904 C0596972 C0030193 C1882272 C2598155 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C0162589 C3267144 C0181588 C0030163 C0810633 C1546728 C3853703 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0027769 C0015385 C0278454 C0040822 C0360457 C1301624 C0151740 C0033845 C0524812 C1306571 C1145670 C0264490 C1444565 C3807376 C0340194 C0398353 C1306232 C0014544 C0004083 C1533734 C0376495 C0199808 C0199810 C0725057 C1536282 C0001563 C0036589 C0150270 C3469597 C0027679 C0642915 C0004259 C1161352 C0077394 ", "concepts": "Chest Tubes, Chest Tube, Chest Tube, Withdrawal, Withdrawal, Withdrawal, evaluation, evaluation, Monitors, Monitor, Pain, Pain, Pain summary, summary Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, problem, problem:, Monitors, Monitor, pain, Pain, Pain, Clinical ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement Withdrawal, Withdrawal, Withdrawal, chest tube, painful, study Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, Monitors, Monitor, scales, scale, scales, scaler, index, Rindex, Pain, Pain, Pain criteria, Eligibility Criteria lung surgery, chest tube, removals, removals pain score, able Criteria pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy, Ablactation, Lactation dysautonomia, Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes, insulin, Insulins, Independent neurological disease, urological disease, neurological lyme disease, agitation, Agitation understand, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol skin abnormalities, Monitors, Monitor, Pain, Pain, Pain, ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement implantable defibrillator, Implantable defibrillator user, Implantable defibrillator leads, pacemaker, pacemakers, Pacemaker, Pacemaker, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, nervous Extremities, extremities, tremor oral morphine, contraindication intracranial hypertension, Benign intracranial hypertension, intracranial hypotension, hepatic insufficiency, respiratory failure, Acute respiratory failure, Cardio-respiratory failure, Early respiratory failure, Type 1 respiratory failure, Type 2 respiratory failure, severed epilepsy, association administration, Readministration, Dpt administration, Mmr administration, administration sets, Maladministrations, oral administration, self administration, Drug administration, drug administration, neostigmine, norneostigmine, Atropine, atropine, tropine "}
