{"text": "TITLE:\n      Multi MERCI (Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia [MERCI\u2122])\nSUMMARY:\n      The primary objectives of the Multi MERCI trial were:\n        -  to evaluate the addition of the Merci L5 Retriever\n        -  additionally permit use of the Merci Retrieval System in the setting of persistent clot\n           following IV t-PA treatment (use in the 0-8 hour window for patients ineligible for IV\n           t-PA was also permitted)\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Per the Multi MERCI protocol, up to 230 patients could be treated at up to 30 centers.\n      The intended trial indication for the Merci L5 Retriever was to restore blood flow in the\n      neurovasculature by removing thrombus in patients experiencing ischemic stroke. Patients\n      that were contraindicated or failed treatment with intravenous t-PA were allowed to be\n      enrolled under the Multi MERCI protocol.\n      Per the Multi MERCI protocol, following inclusion of the Merci L5 Retriever the operating\n      physician was required to initiate treatment with the Merci L5 Retriever. At the physician's\n      discretion, subsequent passes could be made with the Merci L5 Retriever, Merci X6 Retriever\n      and/or Merci X5 Retriever.\n      Adverse events were adjudicated by an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (Capital\n      DSMB).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Angiographically confirmed large vessel ischemic stroke (occlusion may include the\n             following: internal carotid artery (ICA), M1/M2, vertebral, or basilar arteries)\n          -  Intervention is able to be performed within 8 hours of symptom onset\n          -  Patients > 18 years of age\n          -  NIHSS score 8+\n          -  Failed IV t-PA treatment or contraindicated for IV t-PA\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) > 3.0\n          -  Platelet count < 30,000\n          -  Heparin use in previous 24 hours with PTT > 2X normal\n          -  Baseline bloog glucose < 50 mg/dL\n          -  Baseline computed tomography (CT) showing mass effect with midline shift\n          -  Severe sustained hypertension (SBP > 185 or DBP > 110) that cannot be controlled with\n             medication\n          -  Patient is pregnant, has anticipated life expectancy < 3 months, or has severe\n             allergy to contrast medium\n          -  Arterial stenosis > 50% proximal to embolus\n          -  Excessive arterial tortuosity that precludes the study device from reaching the\n             target area\n", "cuis": "C0007785 C0917798 C0699886 C1704212 C0015252 C0728940 C0404831 C1552616 C1706244 C0018017 C2239270 C0404831 C0018792 C0220825 C1514918 C0302148 C3887804 C0546816 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0032143 C0032143 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0404831 C0332155 C0232338 C0455822 C0455848 C1551357 C0018792 C0948008 C0087086 C0302148 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0032143 C1444657 C0421315 C1273094 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0404831 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0404831 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C3245501 C3245502 C1619636 C0804815 C1299583 C0599749 C0011546 C0439857 C0150369 C1283169 C0026426 C0972401 C0877248 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0948008 C0028778 C0854571 C0005847 C0007276 C0007275 C0226157 C1278590 C0226156 C1278588 C0160683 C1305387 C1533000 C0447034 C3469199 C0264967 C0340569 C1181524 C2118683 C0004811 C0549207 C1273869 C1948041 C2979881 C0886296 C1457887 C1299581 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0032143 C1444657 C0421315 C1273094 C0243161 C0525032 C0853225 C0032181 C1287267 C0392386 C0857460 C0019134 C0770546 C1553386 C0017725 C0728774 C0040405 C0412643 C2181323 C0008794 C0860888 C0577559 C2136992 C0728774 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C1547227 C1547231 C1561581 C4050465 C4050466 C0264097 C1306620 C1305849 C0180112 C2911690 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C0549206 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C3840775 C1306232 C1561542 C0020517 C0489531 C1527304 C0719113 C0719656 C3247823 C0009924 C0038449 C0877612 C0877334 C2046122 C0947630 C3279191 C1548344 C2584321 ", "concepts": "Cerebral Ischemia, Cerebral Ischemia, Mechanical, Embolus, Removal, Removal, Multip summary, summary objective, objective, Multip, Atrial Evaluate Retrieval, clot, upsetting, persistence Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, t-PA t-PA description, prescription, prescription Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Multip, untreated blood flow, LV blood flow, RV blood flow, intended, Atrial ischemic stroke, Thrombus, Thrombus, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, t-PA, Contraindicated, HRT contraindicated, OCP contraindicated Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Multip Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Multip Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, required, required, Required, Physician independent, independency, dependency, dependence, monitoring, Monitoring, Monitoring;BP, Board, Adverse event criteria, Eligibility Criteria ischemic stroke, occlusion, Reocclusion, vessel Internal carotid artery, NOS, External carotid artery, Left internal carotid artery, Left internal carotid artery, Right internal carotid artery, Right internal carotid artery, Inj internal carotid art, IC -
