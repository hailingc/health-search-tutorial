{"text": "TITLE:\n      PTA and Drug Eluting Stents for Infrapopliteal Lesions in Critical Limb Ischemia\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of paclitaxel-coated balloon\n      expandable stainless steel coronary stent for the treatment of infrapopliteal stenoses and\n      occlusions in patients with critical limb ischemia compared to percutaneous transluminal\n      balloon angioplasty (PTA).\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a serious condition that is becoming more and more common in\n      the western world due to the growing percentage of elderly in the population and the rising\n      incidence of diabetes. In about 40% of patients a stenosis or occlusion in the arteries\n      below the level of the knee will be present. Restoration of blood flow is imperative to\n      allow pain relief and tissue healing. Without revascularization patients with CLI are at\n      risk for limb loss and potentially fatal complications such as sepsis.\n      In patients treated with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA)significant\n      restenosis is found in approximately 50% after 6 months.\n      In interventional cardiology a significant reduction in restenosis rates in coronary\n      arteries has been found using drug eluting stents (DES), including the paclitaxel eluting\n      stent (TAXUS, Boston Scientific). DES locally deliver drugs (e.g. paclitaxel) that interfere\n      with the restenosis process.\n      Using DES in treating below the knee (infrapopliteal) arterial lesions in patients with CLI\n      may improve patency and clinical outcome.\n      Comparison:\n      Treatment of below the knee arterial lesions in patients with CLI with PTA and DES compared\n      to only PTA.\nELIGIBILITY
