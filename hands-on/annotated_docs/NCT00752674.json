{"text": "TITLE:\n      Neuromuscular Balance in Low Back Pain\nSUMMARY:\n      The research was an interventional study with a quantitative board, fulfilled in a private\n      clinique specialized in trauma service; it was formed between august to October of 2006. The\n      objective was to investigate the effectiveness of neuromuscular balance in lumbar pain. The\n      12 patients, with age between 20 and 55 years, whose did five consultations, with 100%\n      presence, got relief of the pain and increase of movement of hips' articulation which was\n      the most painful movement with 91,66% graduation. All the patients presented the shorting\n      test positive and it kept positive in 7 patients. There was a significant improvement in\n      pain relief (p=0,001,) comparing the first and the fifth consultation, and hip articulation\n      movement. Even after the relief of the pain, 7(58,3%) of the patients kept the treatment for\n      a more effective rehabilitation and prevention of repetition of the symptoms. It was\n      concluded that the neuromuscular balance relieved quickly the pain, being essential for\n      effective rehabilitation of low back pain, with the inclusion of others manual techniques.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The low back pain is a symptom presented in muscle-skeletal change on lumbar region,\n      preferring young adults, in economic active fase. The neuromuscular balance was developed by\n      Soulier when he met the \"activator methods\" which was a pen that create vibrations and\n      consist in a vibration or a micro thrust to reduce the articulation and spinal problems\n      through a non manipulative correction. The research was un interventional study with a\n      quantitative board, fulfilled in a private clinique specialized in trauma service; it was\n      formed between august to October of 2006. The objective was to investigate the effectiveness\n      of neuromuscular balance in lumbar pain. The 12 patients, with age between 20 and 55 years,\n      whose did five consultations, with 100% presence, got relief of the pain and increase of\n      movement of hips' articulation which was the most painful movement with 91,66% graduation.\n      All the patients presented the shorting test positive and it kept positive in 7 patients.\n      There was a significant improvement in pain relief (p=0,001,) comparing the first and the\n      fifth consultation, and hip articulation movement. Even after the relief of the pain,\n      7(58,3%) of the patients kept the treatment for a more effective rehabilitation and\n      prevention of repetition of the symptoms. It was concluded that the neuromuscular balance\n      relieved quickly the pain, being essential for effective rehabilitation of low back pain,\n      with the inclusion of others manual techniques.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients with low back pain between 20 and 55 years old, submitted to a physical\n             therapy treatment.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients with no miofascial low back pain\n", "cuis": "C0024031 C0014653 C0179199 C0560184 C1588717 C1552616 C1706244 C2183254 C1948041 C0886296 C2183253 C2183257
