{"text": "TITLE:\n      A Study of Inhalation of 20,000 EU CCRE in Normal Volunteers Compared to Allergic Asthmatic Individuals\nSUMMARY:\n      This will be a single center, open label study comparing baseline characteristics of\n      recovered sputum cells (collected on screening day) to those of cells recovered 6 hours\n      after inhalational challenge with 20,000 EU Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin (CCRE, a\n      component of air pollution)) within each group as well as cross group comparisons between\n      individuals with allergic asthma (AA's)and normal volunteers (NV's). The primary objective\n      of this study is to test the hypothesis that persons with allergic asthma will have an\n      increased neutrophil response to challenge with 20,000 EU CCRE compared to normal\n      volunteers. Secondary objectives include post CCRE comparison between AA's and NV's with\n      regard to changes in airway cells and blood as well as changes in mucociliary clearance\n      (MCC) in response to inhalation of 20,000 EU CCRE.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This will be a single center, open label study of allergic asthmatic and normal volunteers.\n      The protocol will compare baseline characteristics of recovered sputum cells (collected on\n      screening day) to those of cells recovered 6 hours after inhalational challenge with CCRE\n      within each group as well as cross group comparisons between AA's and NV's. The following\n      information indicates procedures to be performed at each visit as well as the anticipated\n      duration of visits. Subsequent to this description are details regarding specific study\n      procedures.\n      Visit 1: Baseline Visit (5 hours)\n        1. Consent will be obtained, review of subject's medical history, current medications and\n           inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n        2. Vital sign measurements (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure), oxygen\n           saturation, and symptom scoring\n        3. Urine pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential\n        4. Spirometry\n        5. Venipuncture for CBC with differential and baseline blood analyses\n        6. Physical exam of the ears, nose, throat and chest\n        7. Collection of exhaled breath for measurement of nitric oxide level\n        8. Xenon equilibrium gas scan and MCC\n        9. MCC scan\n       10. Sputum induction\n       11. After completion of the sputum induction, subjects will have brief MCC scan (< 10\n           minutes)\n      Visit 2: 24 hours post baseline subjects will return for the following 1 hour visit:\n        1. Review any change in medical status over prior 24 hours, vital signs, O2 saturation and\n           symptom score\n        2. Follow up MCC scan\n      Visit 3: 24-48 hours prior to challenge visit at least 2 days after the baseline visit (\u00bd\n      hour)\n        1. Review change in medical status since last visit; vital signs, oxygen saturation, &\n           symptom score\n        2. Urine pregnancy test\n        3. Spirometry\n      Visit 4: Endotoxin (CCRE) challenge day (8.5 to 9 hours)\n        1. Review any change in medical status since last visit\n        2. Vital signs, oxygen saturation, and symptom score\n        3. Spirometry\n        4. Physical exam of the ears, nose, throat and chest\n        5. If above measures are acceptable, CCRE challenge will be performed\n        6. Post-challenge monitoring including spirometry, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and\n           symptom score at the following intervals post challenge: 30 and 60 minutes and then\n           hourly for 5 additional hours.\n        7. Post challenge venipuncture (blood draw) for CBC with differential and post CCRE blood\n           analyses\n        8. Collection of exhaled breath for measurement of nitric oxide level.\n        9. Four hours post challenge, subject will have MCC evaluated\n       10. After MCC is assessed, sputum induction will be performed.\n       11. After completion of the sputum induction, subjects will have brief MCC scan (< 10\n           minutes)\n       12. Discharge home or, alternatively, to GCRC for overnight observation per study MD.\n      Visit 5: 24 hours post challenge visit (1 hour)\n        1. Subject returns to the CEMALB, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and symptom score\n        2. Collection of exhaled breath for measurement of nitric oxide level.\n        3. Spirometry\n        4. Follow-up MCC scan\n        5. Each volunteer will be given a symptom scoring sheet for each day up to 96 hours (4\n           days) after challenge (see accompanying symptom scoring sheet in Appendix 3).\n      Post Challenge Observations/Reporting (5 minutes)\n      1.
