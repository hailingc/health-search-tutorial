{"text": "TITLE:\n      Pilot Study of Functional and Morphometric Brain Abnormalities Related to Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (MOR-FO-SIA)\nSUMMARY:\n      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a complex deformity with different curves. These\n      different curves may be distinguished by different physiopathologic mechanisms.\n      Without fully convincing model of the emergence and development of AIS, their multifactorial\n      nature seems evident. Several pathophysiological theories involving the central nervous\n      system have been proposed: the AIS would be associated with disturbances of proprioceptive\n      or sensory perception, and/or with integration of this information. This would result in an\n      abnormal body image, responsible for sensorimotor asymmetry that may promote or cause the\n      deformation.\n      The Main aim of this study is to find cortical and subcortical morphometric differences in\n      the most common population of AIS (right thoracic AIS) compared to healthy adolescent\n      control girls.\n      Secondary Objectives are to study the cerebral white matter of the same groups (fractional\n      anisotropy in the main white matter tracts), and activation of sensorimotor neural networks\n      (fMRI activation and functional brain connectivity).\n      Abnormalities of the studied parameters may be used as biomarkers for AIS diagnosis and\n      classification.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  female\n          -  between 14 and 16 years old\n          -  normal neurological examination\n          -  right handed\n          -  informed consent\n          -  informed consent form signed by a parent or a holder of parental authority\n          -  affiliated to medical insurance\n          -  negative urine pregnancy test For patients (A-STD) : right thoracic scoliosis with a\n             Cobb angle between 20 and 40\u00b0 For healthy volunteers (A-N) : no clinical scoliosis\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  pregnant or lactating woman\n          -  antecedents of cranial trauma or cranial intervention, of migraine, of spinal trauma,\n             of scoliosis intervention\n          -  no idiopathic scoliosis\n          -  contraindications to MRI\n          -  patient with a legal protection measure\n", "cuis": "C0445223 C0233492 C0947630 C0006104 C1269537 C1705273 C0015393 C0200760 C1552616 C1706244 C2117111 C0477603 C0939261 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C3853906 C1837655 C1546399 C1553500 C0027769 C0722792 C0277785 C0033499 C0030971 C0234426 C4062886 C3242430 C1561528 C1273518 C0005891 C0332516 C0815275 C0947630 C0200760 C0085632 C0001613 C0007776 C0022655 C1656341 C0817096 C0729233 C3245511 C0686747 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0018017 C2979883 C0006104 C0228174 C1552839 C0947630 C0027627 C0870951 C0598941 C1185740 C0006104 C0376335 C0562230 C0005516 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0449381 C0015393 C0444594 C0457356 C0596463 C1275491 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0027853 C0948463 C1696488 C1112287 C1553386 C0230370 C0009797 C0009797 C1561610 C2090600 C0481840 C0021689 C0430056 C0373524 C0593623 C2188702 C1857790 C1857630 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C1513916 C0563192 C3272565 C0243161 C0549206 C2828358 C3668831 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0149931 C0724401 C0037303 C3263723 C3714660 C0606665 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0477603 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C1545588 C0973449 ", "concepts": "Related, elated, Study, Brains, Brain, Function, Eye Abnormalities, Morphometry summary, summary deformity, Other idiopathic scoliosis, complex b development, Development, Development, Development, No development, model, Multifactorial, emergency, emergency nervous, Prevident, pathophysiology proprioception perception, Apperception, Misperception, informational, Information responsible, body image, symmetry subcortical, study, morphometry, Indifference, Cortical, Cortical, Cortical, Fortical thoracics, Thoracic, common, Healthy adolescent, Fright, Bright, wright, Wright Objective, Objective, cerebral, Cerebral, groups, study, secondary neural network, Neural network, tracts brain, fMRI, hand function biomarkers, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, Parameters, Eye Abnormalities Gass classification, Kiel classification, drug classification, nyha classification criteria, Eligibility Criteria Neurological examination, NOS, Urological examination, Nephrological examination, Neurological examination normal, normal right handed informed consent form informed consent form, signed, signed: medical insurance, major medical insurance Urine pregnancy test, Urine pregnancy test, urine home pregnancy test, urine hCG, pregnancy test, thoracic scoliosis, Mild thoracic scoliosis, Fright, Bright, wright, Wright, Negative Cobb angle, Clinical Criteria pregnant, Lactating, Lactating interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, migraines, Wigraine, cranial, trauma, trauma, pinal interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions Other idiopathic scoliosis contraindication, Contraindication, Contraindication Protection, galega "}
