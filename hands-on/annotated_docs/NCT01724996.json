{"text": "TITLE:\n      Usefulness of Chest Wall Tenderness as Bedside Test to Exclude Acute Coronary Syndrome in Different Demographic Groups\nSUMMARY:\n      To determine the significance of a simple bedside clinical test (chest wall tenderness) to\n      exclude myocardial ischemia in different demographic groups.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      When a patient is presenting with acute chest pain at the ER of the University Hospital of\n      Zurich, the study physician in charge, who is acting simultaneously as one of four attending\n      clinical physicians, is performing the physical examination according to routine clinical\n      practice. The physical examination includes the testing of chest wall tenderness: Palpation\n      of chest wall tenderness in lying 30\u00b0 elevation of chest position. Flat index with\n      standardized pressure where spontaneous maximum pain is reported (reproducible vs. not\n      reproducible pain vs. no pain). Negative control (right side of chest mid-clavicle\n      intercostal 6/7), reproducible vs. not reproducible pain vs. no pain. The same physician,\n      who is blinded for the final diagnosis at the time of the physical examination, is also\n      recording the patient history including the study interview using the standardized study\n      questionnaire.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion criteria: All patients over the age of 18 years presenting with the leading\n        symptom of first time or recurrent acute chest pain in the emergency room of the\n        Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Zurich.\n        Exclusion criteria:\n          -  Missing informed consent.\n          -  Cardiopulmonary unstable patients.\n          -  No self reported chest pain.\n          -  Recent thoracic surgery within1 year, inflammatory joint disease, fibromyalgia,\n             cardiogenic shock.\n", "cuis": "C0948089 C0205076 C0234233 C0684239 C0022885 C0456984 C1552616 C1706244 C0205076 C1279035 C0234233 C0684239 C0392366 C0456984 C0723323 C1272585 C3272565 C0010054 C0151744 C0474714 C0474715 C0919693 C0746731 C0340291 C0474713 C2957453 C2957454 C1552867 C1552839 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0522051 C0947630 C0804815 C0031809 C0944752 C0946068 C2973270 C1444322 C1444324 C3272565 C0031809 C0944752 C0946068 C2973270 C1444322 C1444324 C0205076 C1279035 C0234233 C0684239 C0030247 C0237607 C3245512 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C0205076 C1279035 C0234233 C0684239 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0817096 C0918012 C0770655 C0231519 C0240795 C0556030 C0681324 C2347268 C2322564 C0460139 C0700287 C1549114 C0684224 C0030193 C1183546 C1513916 C0008913 C1279070 C0030193 C0030193 C0804815 C0031809 C0944752 C0946068 C2973270 C1444322 C1444324 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0679831 C1369882 C0935630 C0947630 C0034394 C1706422 C0815327 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0522051 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C1457887 C0013227 C3243280 C0243161 C1551393 C0009797 C0553534 C0443343 C0008031 C1551994 C0524832 C2062975 C2242990 C0022408 C0016053 C1561543 C0442743 C0003209 C0036980 ", "concepts": "Acute Coronary Syndrome, Chest Wall, Tenderness, tenderness, Test, Test summary, summary chest wall, Chest wall, Tenderness, tenderness, test, test, simplet, undetermined significance, Clinical myocardial ischaemia, myocardial ischaemia, EKG myocardial ischemia, ECG myocardial ischemia, Endocardial ischemia, Acute myocardial ischemia, Silent myocardial ischemia, ECG no myocardial ischemia, demand myocardial ischemia, myocardial ischemia supply, exclude, groups description, prescription, prescription acute chest pain study, Physician rnrx physical examination, Eye physical examination, Eye physical examination, Annual physical examination, Assess physical examination, Manage physical examination, Clinical rnrx physical examination, Eye physical examination, Eye physical examination, Annual physical examination, Assess physical examination, Manage physical examination, chest wall, Chest wall, Tenderness, tenderness, Palpation, practices, practice, testing, q testing, t testing chest wall, Chest wall, Tenderness, tenderness, elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation, chest, index, Rindex, opposition, positional, Reposition, exposition, Position, flying pressure, Reported, Unreported, Reported, pain right side of chest, Negative, clavicles, Clavicle, pain pain, Physician rnrx physical examination, Eye physical examination, Eye physical examination, Annual physical examination, Assess physical examination, Manage physical examination, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis patient history, Patient history, interview, study questionnaire, Questionnaires, NET questionnaire criteria, Eligibility criteria acute chest pain, emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency, symptom Medicine, x_Medicine criteria Missing, informed consent form Cardiopulmonary, unstable reported chest pain, self thoracic surgery, post thoracic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, joint disease, fibromyalgia, year, Noninflammatory, Antiinflammatory cardiogenic shock "}
