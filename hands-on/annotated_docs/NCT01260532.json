{"text": "TITLE:\n      The Association of Costimulatory Molecules and PPAR-polymorphisms With Autoimmune Thyroid Disease in Taiwan\nSUMMARY:\n      Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common organ-specific autoimmune disease. AITD\n      include Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Although the pathogenesis of AITD\n      remains unclear, it is generally thought that the mechanisms of the disease is a complex\n      disease in which susceptibility genes and environmental triggers act in concert to initiate\n      the autoimmune response to the thyroid.\n      The initial step of thyroid autoimmunity is the activation of T cells. The activation of T\n      cell requires two signals: firstly, thyroid follicular cells or antigen presenting cells\n      binds to T cell receptor through antigenic HLA complex. Secondly, the activation of T cells\n      is also required the interaction of costimulatory molecules between thyroid follicular cells\n      and immune cells, including CTLA-4, CD 40, CD28, ICOS. PPAR- is a kind of intranuclear\n      transcription factor, associated with adipogenesis and inflammation. Some reports showed\n      that PPAR- polymorphism may have a protective effect from Graves' ophthalmopathy.\n      The goal of the study is to investigate the relationship among SNP and mRNA of costimulatory\n      molecules and PPAR- , serum cytokine including TNF- and sIL-2R, and clinical characteristics\n      in AITD patients. From the study, we hope to clarify the role of costimulatory molecules and\n      PPAR- polymorphism in AITD.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common organ-specific autoimmune disease.
