{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effect of Amlodipine on Anti-platelet Drug Effect in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease\nSUMMARY:\n      Clopidogrel can reduce risk of cardiovascular disease by inhibiting platelet aggregation. It\n      is metabolized to an active drug by a liver enzyme. Its efficacy may be measured by blood\n      sampling for platelet activity, analyzed by VerifyNow device. Calcium Channel blocker (CCB)\n      is also commonly used for blood pressure and anginal control in these patients.\n      Dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blocker (e.g. amlodipine) inhibits this enzyme.\n      There are observational studies reporting dihydropyridine CCB reducing clopidogrel effect,\n      but the clinical implication is unclear.\n      This study test the hypothesis that there is no significant effect of dihydropyridines CCB\n      on clopidogrel response compared with control. After giving consent, patients with\n      suboptimal blood pressure or anginal control will be randomized to receive either\n      dihydropyridine CCB or non-CCB as placebo. These patient will be follow-up in 1 month.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Clopidogrel is a pro-drug, which requires hepatic transformation by the cytochrome P450\n      isoform 3A4 to generate the active metabolite. It inhibits adenosine-5-diphosphate\n      (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation by irreversibly blocking the platelet P2Y12 receptor.\n      However, response to clopidogrel shows wide individual variability, and patients with high\n      on-treatment residual ADP-induced platelet reactivity are at an increased risk of adverse\n      cardiovascular events. Previous study suggest co-administration of CCBs is associated with\n      decreased platelet inhibition by clopidogrel, but these observational studies are confounded\n      by patient's characteristics baseline difference such as proportion of hypertension and\n      diabetes.\n      The objective of this randomized controlled study is to compare amlodipine with placebo on\n      anti-platelet effect of clopidogrel.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  ischemic heart disease patient, and\n          -  given loading or maintenance dose of clopidogrel and in need of it for 1 or more\n             month\n          -  and in need of additional drug for optimal BP control (aim blood pressure <130/90) or\n             angina control.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  existing use of amlodipine\n          -  thrombocytopenia\n          -  end stage renal failure\n          -  allergy to clopidogrel/ amlodipine\n          -  pregnancy/ lactation\n          -  strong inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme within 7 days before start\n             of the study.\n", "cuis": "C1956346 C3640263 C3640260 C0010068 C0051696 C0013227 C1254351 C0032181 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0558373 C0849932 C0264656 C0042373 C0677599 C0920267 C0373809 C0200474 C0855738 C0070166 C0023884 C0005768 C0229664 C0013227 C1254351 C1320102 C0441621 C0006675 C0201925 C2936886 C3540037 C1654653 C0175556 C0870261 C0032181 C0600075 C3668946 C4049938 C0179038 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0020649 C0725357 C2230142 C0020538 C2926615 C0180208 C0428889 C0428886 C0488053 C0497247 C0002962 C2024883 C0006684 C0872271 C0358701 C0573229 C0012315 C3537269 C0220821 C0051696 C1552839 C0012315 C0220821 C3537269 C0070166 C0700287 C0947630 C0175556 C1964257 C0478530 C0700325 C1328018 C0185026 C0009566 C3272565 C0012315 C0220821 C3537269 C0947630 C0392366 C0456984 C0175556 C0070166 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0020649 C0725357 C2230142 C0020538 C2926615 C0180208 C0428889 C0428886 C0488053 C0497247 C0002962 C2024883 C0012315 C0220821 C3537269 C0032042 C1561542 C0175556 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C1510411 C1554215 C3714584 C0005576 C1142081 C2363750 C0070166 C0205054 C0013227 C1254351 C3245501 C3245502 C1320102 C0011164 C0677599 C0920267 C0373809 C0200474 C0855738 C0032181 C0700651 C0233660 C0070166 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0021228 C0391369 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0032181 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C1320716 C1533734 C0376495 C0199808 C0199810 C0725057 C1536282 C0001563 C0036589 C0150270 C3469597 C0947630 C0392386 C0857460 C0070166 C0021467 C0424296 C0947630 C1964257 C0478530 C0700325 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0085632 C3842396 C0022396 C0423864 C0728774 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0051696 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0032042 C0947630 C0282440 C0070166 C0032181 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0151744 C1313980 C0010054 C1510446 C0264694 C0070166 C3244317 C1561542 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0020649 C0725357 C2230142 C0020538 C2926615 C0180208 C0428889 C0428886 C0488053 C0497247 C0013227 C1254351 C0002962 C2024883 C0243161 C0051696 C0040034 C0745013 C1839163 C1861185 C2677608 C2678311 C1856453 C2751260 C0919932 C2349596 C0022661 C2316810 C0020517 C0489531 C1527304 C0719113 C0719656 C3247823 C0070166 C0043084 C0006147 C1552850 C0069695 C0947630 ", "concepts": "Coronary Artery Disease, Coronary Artery Disease Risk, Coronary Artery Disease Symptoms, Coronary Diseases, Amlodipine, Drug, Drug, platelets, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary CVD -
