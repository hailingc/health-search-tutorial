{"text": "TITLE:\n      Magnetic Resonance (MR) Spectroscopy and Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Determining Brain Injury and Subsequent Clinical Outcome in Patients of Moderate Brain Trauma\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion\n      tensor imaging (DTI) to assess for traumatic brain injury and determine if there is any\n      correlation of these findings to clinical outcome. MR spectroscopy using 2D-CSI (a multi\n      voxel technique) of the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, lobar white matter and brainstem may\n      reveal areas of injury and quantification of the metabolites from these areas may be used to\n      correlate with imaging findings and clinical evaluation. White matter disruption in these\n      areas is commonly seen after TBI, caused by diffuse axonal injury. It has been implicated in\n      the long term outcomes in these patients, but has been difficult to assess by standard\n      radiologic studies.\n      By the use of DTI it may be possible to demonstrate damaged white matter tracts which could\n      be helpful in the evaluation of traumatic brain injury. Most TBI subjects have injuries that\n      involved torque to the brain. This results in a shearing injury to the long white matter\n      tracts, which has been hypothesized to be related to cognitive outcome.\n      Also, to demonstrate that MRS and DTI prove valuable in predicting outcome in patients of\n      moderate brain trauma by conducting progressive studies acutely (within 24 hours) and long\n      term (4-6 weeks). Most patients will most likely be followed clinically for over a year,\n      and, if clinical indicated, farther scanning can be done at a later date.\n      By comparing fraction anisotropy, ADC values, and metabolic ratios by the use of DTI and MRS\n      in the adult and pediatric populations, may help to assess differences in recovery.\n      Lastly, a comparison between the two groups in changes in brain metabolism and/or white\n      matter tract disruption/re-connection after TBI with and/or without links to outcome can be\n      done.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The purpose of this study is to determine if MRI imaging can accurately detect the clinical\n      outcome (extent of recovery) of patients who have moderate to severe brain injury. This\n      study may show that MRI can provide a clearer picture on the extent of the brain injury and\n      help medical physicians decide how to best treat these patients with a more accurate idea of\n      the brain function of the recovering patient.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients of acute moderate brain trauma\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients who are medically unstable or have CT findings that may interfere with the\n             study such as:\n               -  a large hemorrhage or edema\n               -  encephalomalacia\n               -  prior neurosurgeries\n               -  hardware placed in the head or neck\n               -  prior head trauma\n               -  history of neurological conditions\n", "cuis": "C1537007 C0037812 C0024487 C0013845 C0376519 C0877853 C0270611 C0876926 C0231881 C3272565 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0024487 C0877853 C2022189 C2322077 C1522706 C0412743 C0412747 C2315284 C0947630 C0026266 C0876926 C0006107 C2832052 C0272927 C2832047 C0079595 C0024487 C0013845 C0376519 C0037812 C0404831 C2926606 C3272565 C0010090 C0004781 C0006121 C1306665 C0025664 C3263723 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0079595 C2926606 C3272565 C0752219 C1299586 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0947630 C1185740 C0010957 C0876926 C0006107 C2832052 C0272927 C2832047 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C3263723 C0205013 C0018767 C0018786 C1455844 C2015933 C3263723 C0006104 C1185740 C0233492 C0445356 C0024487 C0026266 C1516986 C0700164 C0876926 C0947630 C3839460 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C1561543 C0441633 C0034606 C1444656 C3272565 C0024487 C0026266 C2707259 C0429585 C0430943 C1290755 C0040597 C1554103 C1552861 C2004454 C0876889 C0220644 C0220645 C0085632 C0025519 C3822292 C1552839 C0006104 C1185740 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0079595 C0442726 C0947630 C3272565 C0270611 C2004454 C1306232 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C0270611 C0947630 C1555587 C1552861 C0031843 C1705273 C0006104 C0180153 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0876926 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C0243161 C0443343 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C2926606 C0947630 C0019080 C0017181 C1861265 C0013604 C0014068 C3670122 C0268685 C0018670 C0152336 C0027530 C2137077 C0018674 C0262926 C2004062 C0012634 C2707261 C3845870 ", "concepts": "Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Spectroscopy, Spectroscopy, MR, ESR Spectroscopy, NIR Spectroscopy, NMR Spectroscopy, Brain Injury, Brain Trauma, Resonance, Clinical, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary mrs, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of heart, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of brain, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of head, Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of body, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of prostate, study, mrs TBI (traumatic brain injury), Mild traumatic brain injury, focal traumatic brain injury, Closed traumatic brain injury, diffuse traumatic brain injury, imaging MR spectroscopy, EPR spectroscopy, NIR spectroscopy, spectroscopy, multip, Findings, Clinical corpus callosum, basal ganglia, brainstem, Brainstem, techniques injury Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, imaging, Findings, Clinical diffuse axonal injury difficulty, standards, Standard, Standard studies tracts, damage TBI (traumatic brain injury), Mild traumatic brain injury, focal traumatic brain injury, Closed traumatic brain injury, diffuse traumatic brain injury, Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, injuries shearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, injury, brain tracts, elated, Unrelated mrs, mrs, Evaluable, proven brain trauma, studies, Nonprogressive, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate year Scanning, Scanning, Indicated, Clinical mrs, mrs, Metabolic, refraction, Refraction, Abfraction, Traction, Fraction help, recover, Pediatric, pediatric HD, pediatric st, Indifference metabolism, H2 metabolism, groups, brain tract description, prescription, prescription imaging, detect, study, Clinical brain injury, recover, severed, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate brain injury, study, provider help function, Function, brain, covering criteria, Eligibility Criteria brain trauma, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate Criteria unstable, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Findings study hemorrhage, GI hemorrhage, No hemorrhage, edema encephalomalacia, Leukoencephalomalacia, Avian encephalomalacia head, head, neck, neck head trauma history, history, condition, Neurological, ICU.neurological "}
