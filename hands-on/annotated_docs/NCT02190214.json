{"text": "TITLE:\n      Thyroid Disorders in Malaysian: A Nationwide Multicentre Study\nSUMMARY:\n      This will be a population based study looking at the prevalence of thyroid disorders in\n      Malaysia (including hypo- and hyperthyroidism, subclinical hypo- or hyperthyroidism) and its\n      association with different ethnicity and iodine status. The study will also look at genetic\n      susceptibility for autoimmune thyroid disorders in the Malaysian population\n      General hypotheses:\n      The prevalence of thyroid disorders in Malaysia is 10% for hypothyroidism and 2% for\n      hyperthyroidism Hypo- and hyperthyroidism is associated with iodine status in our population\n      There are different susceptibility gene for autoimmune thyroid disorder in different\n      ethnicity in our population\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This will be a cross-sectional population based study involving Malaysian adults (aged 18\n      year old and above). Cluster sampling will be used to select respondents that will be\n      representative of the Malaysian population. Selected respondent will be interviewed,\n      anthropometric measurement taken, blood and urine sample taken.\n      Blood will be analyzed for thyroid function (thyroxine, triiodothyronine and thyroid\n      stimulating hormone), autoantibodies (anti-thyroperoxidase and anti-thyroglobulin). Urine\n      will be analyzed for urinary iodine.\n      Those diagnosed with autoimmune thyroid disorders with strong family history of thyroid\n      disorders (multiplex multi-generation family involvement) will have their blood sent for\n      whole exome sequencing and linkage analysis done to identify possible susceptible gene for\n      autoimmune thyroid disorders\n      Respondents detected to have hypo- or hyper- and subclinical hypo- or hyperthyroidism will\n      be referred to their nearest health centre for further evaluation and treatment appropriate\n      for their condition.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Aged equal or more than 18 years old at the time of sampling\n          -  Malaysian citizen\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Respondents who did not give consent\n", "cuis": "C0040128 C0030517 C0947630 C1552616 C1706244 C0040128 C0030517 C0154164 C0162044 C0455487 C0947630 C0020550 C0455485 C0004083 C0086168 C0021968 C0885449 C0947630 C1948182 C1553821 C0040128 C0030517 C0154164 C0162044 C0455487 C0012655 C3838076 C0443146 C3812897 C3891294 C0040128 C0030517 C0154164 C0162044 C0455487 C0020676 C0455486 C0020550 C0455485 C0021968 C0885449 C0040128 C0030517 C0455487 C0012655 C3838076 C0443146 C1328018 C1553821 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0947630 C1552858 C0441621 C1555715 C2609437 C1561543 C0935630 C1610733 C0005768 C0229664 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C2242456 C0040130 C0041014 C0428419 C2936843 C3853639 C0040165 C0079691 C0202231 C1281902 C0040132 C0040134 C2228489 C0076638 C0117002 C0229664 C0851353 C0179038 C3833453 C3250220 C1272321 C0040123 C0337445 C1527123 C0042036 C1547942 C1610733 C2963137 C3272921 C0021968 C0885449 C0179038 C0040128 C0030517 C0154164 C0162044 C0455487 C0241889 C0332123 C1397163 C1397164 C2584882 C0443146 C0011900 C1408353 C0040132 C0040134 C2228489 C0076638 C0117002 C0012634 C0007222 C0017178 C0005768 C0229664 C0011164 C0349676 C0404831 C0796345 C2827758 C1294197 C1553778 C3858576 C0040128 C0030517 C0154164 C0162044 C0455487 C0443146 C0020550 C0455485 C0442726 C1511790 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1550488 C1554180 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0441621 C0243161 ", "concepts": "Thyroid Gland Disorders, Parathyroid Disorders, Study summary, summary thyroid gland disorders, parathyroid disorders, Other thyroid disorders, Thyroid disorders NEC, H/O: thyroid disorder, study hyperthyroidism, H/O: hyperthyroidism association, Dissociation, iodines, iodines, study, genetics, Ethnicity thyroid gland disorders, parathyroid disorders, Other thyroid disorders, Thyroid disorders NEC, H/O: thyroid disorder, susceptibility, COPD susceptibility, autoimmune General, General thyroid gland disorders, parathyroid disorders, Other thyroid disorders, Thyroid disorders NEC, H/O: thyroid disorder, hypothyroidism, H/O: hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism, H/O: hyperthyroidism, iodines, iodines thyroid gland disorder, parathyroid disorder, H/O: thyroid disorder, susceptibility, COPD susceptibility, autoimmune, Therex Ethnicity description, prescription, prescription study, section sampling, Cluster, Clusterin, year interview urine sample, blood, blood, ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement thyroid function, thyroid function test, Total triiodothyronine, Triiodothyronine, l-Triiodothyronine, Triiodothyronine T3, l thyroxine, L-thyroxine, Thyroxine, Thyroxine, thyroids, thyroid, thyroid, thyroidin, Euthyroid, Blood, Blood, analyzer autoantibodies, csf autoantibodies, autoantibodies test, tg thyroglobulin, Thyroglobulin, Thyroglobulin, Urine, Urine, Urine, Urine, Thyroperoxidase iodines, iodines, analyzer thyroid gland disorders, parathyroid disorders, Other thyroid disorders, Thyroid disorders NEC, H/O: thyroid disorder, family history, No family history, family history; eye, family history; ear, HIV; family history, autoimmune, diagnosed, Undiagnosed, thyroids, thyroid, thyroid, thyroidin, Euthyroid disorders, CV disorders, GI disorders, blood, blood, degenerations, Regeneration, multip linkage analysis, Susceptible, Sequencing, Sequencing, deidentify thyroid gland disorders, parathyroid disorders, Other thyroid disorders, Thyroid disorders NEC, H/O: thyroid disorder, autoimmune hyperthyroidism, H/O: hyperthyroidism, detected, Detected Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, referrer, Deferred condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition criteria, Eligibility Criteria sampling Criteria "}
