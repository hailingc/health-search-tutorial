{"text": "TITLE:\n      Cetuximab Plus Radiotherapy Versus Cisplatin Plus Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer\nSUMMARY:\n      BACKGROUND:\n      Concomitant radiotherapy and cisplatin (CDDP) based chemotherapy is the standard treatment\n      for LA-NHSCC. This combined modality treatment is linked with considerable acute local and\n      systemic toxicity.EGFR is overexpressed in 90-100% of the HNSCC cases and is considered an\n      unfavourable prognostic marker. EGFR costitutive activation is linked with HNSCC\n      pathogenesis.\n      Cetuximab is a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody blocking the activation of the receptor and\n      signal transduction. Cetuximab combined with radiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy only\n      in the treatment of LA-HNSCC and is characterized by an acceptable toxicity profile.\n      RATIONALE:\n      A direct comparison between concomitant chemoradiotherapy with Cisplatin and the concomitant\n      treatment with radiotherapy associated to cetuximab does not exist.\n      STUDY DESIGN:\n      Arm A: Radical radiotherapy (doses and volumes) concomitant with chemotherapy with Cisplatin\n      (40 mg/mq/week) Arm B: Radical radiotherapy (doses and volumes) concomitant with therapy\n      with the monoclonal antibody Cetuximab (400 mg/m2 [\"loading dose\"] and subsequently 250 mg\n      /m2/week)\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n      Evaluation and comparison of the compliance of the two treatments;\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n      Evaluation and comparison of the grade and incidence of acute toxicity; Evaluation and\n      comparison of local control; Evaluation and comparison of event free survival (both local\n      control and distant metastases); Evaluation and comparison of cause specific and overall\n      survival.\n      INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA\n        -  Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy obtained from the tumor and/or\n           from its lymphnodal metastases) originating from oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharinx,\n           supraglottic larynx;\n        -  Locally advanced disease, defined by one of the following criteria: every T, N+, M0 (\n           T1, N1 cases excluded); T3-4, N0, M0;\n
