{"text": "TITLE:\n      Home Hypnotherapy for Refractory Functional Chest Pain: A Pilot Study\nSUMMARY:\n      The primary aim is to develop and test the feasibility of a standardized digital audio\n      home-hypnotherapy (HHT) program for patients with refractory functional chest pain (FCP).\n      The secondary aims of this study are:\n        1. To obtain pilot data to assess the magnitude of the treatment effect of self-hypnosis\n           in refractory FCP for an anticipated future, larger treatment trial;\n        2. To determine the stability of the treatment effect of HHT in refractory FCP;\n        3. To assess the relationship between response to HHT and psychological factors; and\n        4. To assess the relationship between response to HHT and symptomatic dimensions of chest\n           pain (severity, frequency, and duration).\n        5. To assess the difference\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Eligible patients with refractory FCP will be randomized to one of 2 arms: the active\n      treatment group, who will receive the HHT program; or a control group. Patients in the\n      active treatment group will receive the 12-week digital audio HHT program. This protocol\n      consists of 7 sessions, each approximately 30-40 minutes, administered every 2 weeks, for a\n      cumulative 12 weeks of treatment, along with a shorter (approximately 12 minute) session\n      administered daily. Patients in the control group will receive a digital audio educational\n      program. Subjects in both groups will be assessed at baseline, 4-6 weeks into treatment, at\n      the end of the treatment, and 3 months after conclusion of the program. Global change in\n      symptoms will be assessed with a 7-point Likert scale. Patients will be considered to\n      respond if they have significant improvement on the Likert scale at the post-treatment\n      visit. Patients will complete a chest pain symptom diary, the SCL-90 and the Coping\n      Strategies Questionnaire-Catastrophizing subscale to assess psychological features, and the\n      SF-36 as a measure of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Age 18 to 80, male or female.\n          -  Patients must fulfill the Rome III criteria for Functional Chest Pain of Presumed\n             Esophageal Origin for the previous 3 months (with symptom onset at least 6 months\n             before diagnosis), including all of the following:\n               -  Midline chest pain or discomfort that is not of burning quality\n               -  Absence of evidence that gastroesophageal reflux is the cause of the symptom\n               -  Absence of histopathology-based esophageal motility disorders\n          -  Persistent symptoms despite a trial of antidepressant therapy, as defined by either:\n               -  chest pain despite at least a continuous 4-week trial of at least one\n                  antidepressant within the last 6 months; or\n               -  intolerance of at least one antidepressant within the last 6 months.\n          -  Negative cardiac evaluation (negative cardiac stress test or negative coronary\n             angiogram)\n          -  Negative gastrointestinal evaluation for cause of the pain, defined by absence of Los\n             Angeles grade C or D erosive esophagitis on endoscopy, persistent chest pain on PPI\n             therapy, and no association of chest pain with reflux episodes on an ambulatory pH or\n             pH-impedance study, defined as a symptom index <50% or symptom association\n             probability <95% for chest pain .\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Severe co-morbid illness (cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hematologic, hepatic)\n          -  Prior treatment with hypnosis/hypnotherapy for a medical condition\n          -  Prior major thoracic surgery\n          -  Prior diagnosis of or treatment for dissociative disorders, post-traumatic stress\n             disorder, borderline personality disorder, or other psychiatric disorders
