{"text": "TITLE:\n      nuMoM2b Heart Health Study\nSUMMARY:\n      This study is looking at the relationship between experiences during pregnancy and\n      cardiovascular health 2 to 3\u00bd years later. The investigators are recruiting women from the\n      approximately 10,000 women who were enrolled and followed over the course of their first\n      pregnancy in another study.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), in collaboration with the Eunice\n      Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, is funding this\n      follow-up study of the nuMoM2b cohort to evaluate the association between adverse pregnancy\n      outcomes (APOs) and cardiovascular health approximately 2 to 3\u00bd years postpartum. The study,\n      called the nuMoM2b Heart Health Study or nuMoM2b HHS, utilizes the extensive database and\n      tissue bank developed for nuMoM2b in which nulliparous women are evaluated over the course\n      of pregnancy to study the mechanisms for and prediction of APOs. Women enrolled in the\n      nuMoM2b cohort are extremely well phenotyped through prospective data collection, clinical\n      evaluations, and ultrasound assessments, as well as through the use of standardized\n      definitions. Demographic, psychosocial, dietary, physiologic, and outcome information were\n      collected through maternal interviews, self-administered questionnaires, clinical\n      measurements, ultrasounds, and medical record abstraction. Samples of maternal blood, urine,\n      and cervico-vaginal fluid over pregnancy and cord blood and placenta at delivery were\n      collected and banked. All women completed two sleep questionnaires and over 3,600 had\n      objective overnight sleep studies at two times during pregnancy.\n      Women participating in the nuMoM2b are assessed in nuMoM2b HHS for evidence of\n      cardiovascular disease risk (CVDR), including sleep disordered breathing (SDB), at 2 to 3\u00bd\n      years postpartum. APOs in subsequent pregnancies also are assessed. This study characterizes\n      the relationship between APOs and CVDR, identify first pregnancy profiles that portend\n      subsequent CVDR, determine associations between SDB during the first pregnancy and\n      subsequent CVDR, and identify modifiable factors that mediate the associations between CVDR\n      and APOs in the first and subsequent pregnancy. This follow-up study will allow for the\n      development of strategies to modify these CVDR factors and to improve the health of women\n      suffering APOs.\n      The nuMoM2b Heart Health Study is a prospective observational study that includes interval\n      contacts and a detailed cardiovascular assessment 2 to 3\u00bd years after delivery of the index\n      pregnancy. At the cardiovascular assessment, potentially eligible women are invited to\n      attend a cardiovascular screening visit. After informed consent, a urine pregnancy test is\n      performed to confirm eligibility. The visit includes clinical and laboratory measurements as\n      well as a structured interview to assess domains that were measured in the nuMoM2b\n      pregnancy: physical activity, depression, social support, psychological stress, and\n      nutritional status. Women with sleep breathing assessments during their nuMoM2b pregnancy\n      are offered another overnight sleep study.\n      The overarching goal is to better define the relation between outcomes of pregnancy and long\n      term health of the mother. The specific aims are as follows:\n      Aim 1: Define the incidence of hypertension and the cardiovascular disease risk (CVDR)\n      profile of women approximately 2 to 3\u00bd years after a first pregnancy complicated by\n      preeclampsia or other adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs: stillbirth, small for gestational\n      age at birth [SGA], preterm birth, preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertension,\n      gestational diabetes [GDM]) compared to women having no APOs in the first pregnancy.\n      Aim 2: Identify a profile in early pregnancy that portends subsequent CVDR approximately 2\n      to 3\u00bd years postpartum.\n      Aim 3: Determine whether pregnancy and postpartum sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is\n      associated with increased CVDR and identify specific patterns of pregnancy and postpartum\n      SDB that increase CVDR.\n      Aim 4: Identify modifiable factors during and after pregnancy that mediate the associations\n      between APOs and the CVDR during pregnancy and approximately 2 to 3\u00bd years postpartum.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n        Interval Contact:\n          -  Agreed to contact for future
