{"text": "TITLE:\n      Pre-discharge vs. Early Post-discharge Stress Testing and GRACE Score for Safe Discharge of ACS-patients With a Negative Hs-troponin T Result\nSUMMARY:\n      New high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays allow earlier detection of acute\n      myocardial infarction (AMI). Furthermore, elevated values were associated with an increased\n      risk of recurrent AMI or death. Therefore, guidelines recommend an early invasive strategy\n      in patients with elevated admission values and kinetic changes. Other criteria for an early\n      invasive strategy include a GRACE risk score >140 points or other cardiovascular risk\n      factors. Hs-cTn assays allow discrimination of patients at very low and high risk. Studies\n      confirmed safety of early discharge protocols in patients with unstable angina (UAP). The\n      aim of this study is to 1) confirm the safety of early discharge without invasive strategy\n      in patients with UAP and to 2) review the optimal timing of stress-testing. Therefore,\n      patients are being randomized into 2 groups with pre-discharge and early post-discharge\n      stress-testing. Endpoints are major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 and 90 days.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  patients presenting to the emergency department (\"chest pain unit\")\n          -  typical angina pectoris\n          -  absence of symptoms since presentation\n          -  at least 18 years\n          -  low GRACE risk score (<140 points)\n          -  informed consent, signed agreement\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  conditions with need for immediate workup\n          -  mental disorders\n          -  dementia\n          -  pregnancy, breast feeding\n", "cuis": "C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C4071100 C1513916 C0038435 C0723460 C2825142 C4050231 C1141947 C1552616 C1706244 C1096316 C0585642 C0883409 C0523953 C0237677 C0020517 C0312418 C0427965 C1511790 C1510438 C1254223 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727 C2348362 C1168331 C0455406 C0340324 C1998297 C0340312 C0340325 C0428950 C2825159 C0856882 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C0162791 C0220845 C0282423 C0679199 C0011065 C1306577 C1334278 C0184666 C0809949 C0243161 C1546725 C1546836 C1546840 C1547233 C1547241 C1547267 C1547272 C1547281 C1547304 C1547309 C1547994 C1549063 C1549110 C1556055 C1561608 C1868670 C2598149 C1955473 C0856882 C3887460 C0007220 C0436125 C0497234 C0679199 C1334278 C0012632 C0234688 C0848490 C1821674 C0442811 C1510438 C1254223 C0002965 C0340288 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C0442711 C1507394 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C0679199 C0947630 C1334278 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C0282443 C0038435 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C1552839 C1320716 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C0038435 C3842337 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0008031 C2926613 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C1998435 C0741026 C0231221 C0233256 C1389312 C1550472 C1561610 C2090600 C0009797 C0243161 C1697779 C0012634 C0004936 C0033975 C1704330 C0032045 C0178546 C0270489 C0011265 C0497327 C0006147 C1623040 C1623041 C0420983 C0438100 C0558161 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 ", "concepts": "discharge, discharge, discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge dx, Negative, Stress, Stress, Result, Score, Troponin T summary, summary cardiac troponin, cardiac troponin T, Cardiac troponin I, Cardiac troponin T, insensitivity, Sensitivity, Sensitivity, Sensitivity, Detection, assay, mallow Myocardial infarction, NOS, Myocardial infarction, Healed myocardial infarction, ECG: myocardial infarction, atrial myocardial infarction, Acute myocardial infarction, First myocardial infarction, septal myocardial infarction, Septal myocardial infarction, Apical myocardial infarction, FH: Myocardial infarction, Silent myocardial infarction, Recent myocardial infarction, Lateral myocardial infarction, Aborted myocardial infarction, ECG: no myocardial infarction, Date of myocardial infarction, K+ increased, CK increased, LH increased, PT increased, QT increased, pH increased, GH increased, increased mg, CI increased, Na increased, Zn increased, T4 increased, T3 increased Guidelines, guidelines, guideline, strategy, deaths, death, Invasive admissions, Admission, criteria, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Others, elevated k cardiovascular, cardiovascular drug, cardiovascular exam, Pain;cardiovascular, strategy, Invasive discrimination, Hue discrimination, race discrimination, Cold discrimination, very low, assay, mallow unstable angina, stable angina, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, protocol, protocol Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, strategy, study, Invasive testing, q testing, t testing, review, stress Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, groups cardiovascular events, testing, q testing, t testing, stress, 0 days criteria, Eligibility Criteria chest pain, Chest pain, emergency, emergency, Emergency, Emergency typical angina pectoris, atypical angina pectoris absence of symptoms, malpresentation, leg presentation low signed, signed:, informed consent form Criteria immediate, condition Mental disorder, mental disorder, Dental disorder, Placental disorders, child mental disorders, Other mental disorders dementia, dementia breast feedings, Breast feeding, Breast feeding, breast feeding stop, H/O: breast feeding, breast feeding pain, pregnancy, c.pregnancy, Pregnancy "}
