{"text": "TITLE:\n      the Role of Total Body Imaging in Asymptomatic Pediatric Trauma Patients\nSUMMARY:\n      Whole body imaging has no role in asymptomatic pediatric trauma patients\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Negative physical examination alone has been shown unreliable for excluding intra-abdominal\n      injuries in adult patients with multitrauma. Therefore, the management of patients with a\n      normal clinical examination after blunt trauma is a subject of controversy. Since 1970s,\n      computer tomography (CT) has become the mainstay of evaluating hemodynamically stable trauma\n      patients. It's generally accepted that hemodynamically stable patient with abnormal\n      abdominal examination results require the use of CT as well as patients with depressed level\n      of consciousness. Controversy exists with the awake, clinically evaluable patients with no\n      obvious signs of abdominal and chest trauma. In the last years number of studies express CT\n      role in evaluation of asymptomatic trauma patient with mechanism of injury supporting\n      probability of internal organs injury. Those studies show that in a large number of patients\n      the management was changed according to CT results. The authors recommended liberal use of\n      CT in trauma patient population. All those studies have been performed in adult trauma\n      patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of whole body imaging in\n      pediatric patients with suspicious mechanism of injury, which are hemodynamically stable and\n      has no obvious signs of chest and abdominal injury. The incidence of injury in these patient\n      population as well as changes in treatment based on results of CT will be examined. Methods\n      The prospective observational study will be performed in Assaf Harofeh Medical Center. All\n      patients up to 15 years old with blunt mechanism of multisystem trauma will be eligible for\n      enrollment to the study. Only patients whose parents singed the inform consent will be\n      enrolled.Inclusion criteria will be based on the mechanism of injury: 1. no visible injury\n      of chest and abdomen2. hemodynamically stable3. normal abdominal examination in\n      neurologically intact patient or unevaluable abdominal examination in patients with\n      depressed level of consciousness. 4. significant mechanism of injury as any of the following\n      a. high speed (more than 55km/hr) motor vehicle accident b. fall of greater than 3 meters c.\n      automobile hitting pedestrian d. assaulted with depressed level of consciousness All\n      patients will undergo CT of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis as a part of their\n      evaluation. CT scan will be performed in Emergency Department short after patient's\n      admission and clinical evaluation. An abnormal CT will be defined as exhibiting any\n      traumatic abnormality. Patient treatment plan changes will be defined as alteration in\n      management based directly on CT findings.Data regarding patient demographics, mechanism of\n      injury, physical examination findings, Glasgow Coma Score on emergency department admission,\n      Injury Severity Score, radiologic interpretation of chest and pelvic roentgenograms,\n      injuries required operative procedures, laboratory data, CT scan findings, and changes in\n      management plan based on CT findings will be recorded.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  All asymptomatic trauma patients from 0 to 15 years old\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Any pediatric trauma patients with clinical indications for CT scan\n", "cuis": "C0231221 C0876889 C0587599 C1951312 C0220644 C0011923 C0079595 C0043251 C3263723 C3714660 C1551342 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0203669 C0231221 C0343751 C3263723 C3714660 C1704326 C0876889 C0220644 C0220645 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0031809 C0944752 C0946068 C2973270 C1444322 C1444324 C0000726 C0000737 C1513916 C3858758 C0376636 C3263723 C0031809 C1456356 C0043253 C1553386 C0040395 C0040405 C0034579 C3263723 C3714660 C0578150 C0578150 C0031809 C0582103 C0000726 C0000737 C0344315 C0520887 C3245501 C3245502 C0009791 C0234421 C0041657 C0517960 C3825622 C0751055 C0234422 C1516986 C0039980 C0000726 C0000737 C0947630 C0231221 C0343751 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C3263723 C3714660 C1704326 C0947630 C0178784 C3263723 C2360800 C3244072 C0376636 C0442739 C0947630 C3263723 C3714660 C0203669 C0947630 C1704326 C0220825 C3263723 C0578150 C4050405 C0876889 C0220644 C0220645 C0848377 C0272430 C3263723 C0817096 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0332128 C0000589 C0025638 C0025663 C2827714 C2828387 C0199168 C1561579 C3810851 C0947630 C1964257 C0478530 C0700325 C3263723 C3714660 C3888021 C1516879 C0700287 C0947630 C1720467 C0243161 C3263723 C0031809 C0582103 C0000726 C0000737 C1553386 C0817096 C0578150 C0230168 C0031809 C0582103 C0000726 C0000737 C0234425 C4050479 C0436581 C4062281 C0513506 C0344315 C0520887 C3263723 C0000932 C2063147 C1290896 C0441074 C0085639 C0234425 C4050479 C0436581 C4062281 C0513506 C1553690 C0344315 C0520887 C2063136 C0004063 C0202691 C3853780 C0412618 C0000726 C0230168 C0030797 C0817096 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C1546844 C2745965 C1546399 C1553500 C0726021 C0040405 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0015272 C0184666 C0809949 C3272565 C0599880 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0221206 C3472453 C0076106 C0376636 C4049674 C2926606 C0031809 C0944752 C0946068 C2973270 C1444322 C1444324 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C0184666 C0809949 C3263723 C4050231 C0009421 C2926606 C0459471 C3173575 C0438154 C0456377 C1306645 C2983285 C3263722 C3263723 C0030797 C4050231 C0817096 C0543467 C0205908 C0205903 C0393091 C2004312 C2004311 C1579901 C1276305 C3263723 C3245501 C3245502 C1619636 C0040405 C3245479 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C2926606 C0376636 C2926606 C0182913 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0231221 C0343751 C3263723 C3714660 C0243161 C0040405 C3263723 C3714660 C0876889 C0220644 C0220645 C3272565 ", "concepts": "Asymptomatic, Pediatric, Pediatrics, Pediatrix, Pediatric HD, Imaging, Imaging, Traumas, Trauma, Trauma, Body, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary Whole body imaging, asymptomatic, asymptomatic HIV, trauma, trauma, role, Pediatric, pediatric HD, pediatric st description, prescription, prescription rnrx physical examination, Eye physical examination, Eye physical examination, Annual physical examination, Assess physical examination, Manage physical examination, abdominal, abdominalgia, Negative, reliable management, injuries Clinical examination, NOS, clinical;
