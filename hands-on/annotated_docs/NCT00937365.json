{"text": "TITLE:\n      Pregnancy-Related Low Back Pain and Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Treatment\nSUMMARY:\n      This study compares three treatments for low back pain that started during pregnancy. The\n      study hypothesizes that exercise, spinal manipulation, and a mind-body technique called\n      neuroemotional technique (NET) equally affect pain intensity and disability associated with\n      pregnancy-related low back pain. The study also hypothesizes that pain intensity and\n      disability levels do not influence maternal heart rate variability (a measure of stress) and\n      intrauterine attachment (a measure of relationship quality). Ten women will additionally\n      provide blood and salivary oxytocin samples during pregnancy and periodically for three\n      months after birth. These women and their babies will also be videotaped playing for 5\n      minutes at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months postpartum.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Pregnancy-related low back pain is experienced by over half of all pregnant women. In the\n      United States it is thought of as a normal constituent of pregnancy. However, in Europe low\n      back pain associated with pregnancy is treated. In the United States pregnancy-related low\n      back pain is thought to resolve with birth. However about 1/3 of women who experience\n      pregnancy-related low back pain continue to experience back pain for one year postpartum.\n      Those women whose low back pain persists into the postpartum period are more at risk of\n      experiencing comorbidities such as postpartum depression.\n      In the extrauterine life maternal pain limits a mother's ability to securely attach with her\n      child. Furthermore, interpretation of pain intensity is influenced by the type of attachment\n      the individual has with her parents. Little is known how maternal pain may influence\n      intrauterine attachment. Similarly, heart rate variability is influenced by pain and by\n      spinal manipulation in non-pregnant populations. However, normal non-pregnant patterns of\n      heart rate variability are altered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and\n      little is known about why this happens or what this means.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Healthy\n          -  20-49 years old\n          -  Pregnant with a singleton\n          -  Low back pain began during pregnancy and has lasted more than one week\n          -  Low back pain is reproducible with palpation\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cancer, thyroid condition etc.\n          -  Pain radiates below knee\n          -  Cannot read English\n          -  Plans to move away from Portland area during pregnancy\n          -  Not willing to be randomized to one of the three arms of the study\n", "cuis": "C1148475 C1880152 C0024031 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0445223 C0233492 C1552616 C1706244 C0024031 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C0814472 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0947630 C0086586 C0947630 C0229992 C0152338 C0025664 C0452240 C1522704 C1320357 C2707298 C0231170 C0001721 C2237113 C0025664 C1320357 C2707298 C0024031 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0947630 C0233492 C0445356 C0231170 C0018810 C2041121 C2197023 C0488794 C3845990 C1858460 C0721591 C0038435 C0391369 C0185023 C0237497 C0185042 C1314972 C1999228 C2825781 C1947905 C0459867 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0030095 C0030094 C0523809 C1704206 C0005768 C0229664 C1555587 C0031082 C0600138 C0005615 C1550722 C3245487 C1561542 C0285521 C1561542 C0886384 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0024031 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0549206 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0233492 C0445356 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C1553386 C1550472 C0004604 C1963071 C0677061 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C1550472 C0233492 C0445356 C0332155 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0004604 C1963071 C0677061 C0005615 C1550722 C3245487 C3714811 C0024031 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0004604 C1963071 C0677061 C1561543 C0233492 C0445356 C0024031 C0025344 C0221074 C0342069 C3494641 C0342071 C1858460 C0721591 C0030193 C0237094 C0237133 C0237142 C0237155 C0237161 C0237162 C0237169 C0237178 C0237185 C0237206 C0237221 C0237228 C0237247 C0237255 C0237276 C0237283 C0237289 C0237305 C0237318 C0237324 C0237338 C0237357 C0237361 C0237369 C0237373 C0237380 C0237387 C1948167 C1948168 C1948169 C1948170 C1948171 C1948173 C1948174 C1948176 C1948178 C1948179 C1948180 C1948181 C0459471 C3173575 C0438154 C0456377 C1320357 C2707298 C0185023 C0237497 C0185042 C1314972 C1999228 C2825781 C1947905 C1858460 C0721591 C0023882 C0030193 C3845898 C0021228 C0185023 C0237497 C0185042 C1314972 C1999228 C2825781 C1947905 C0018810 C2041121 C2197023 C0488794 C3845990 C0030193 C0391369 C0086586 C0549206 C1553386 C0018810 C2041121 C2197023 C0488794 C3845990 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0391369 C3845898 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0481462 C0723338 C0549206 C0024031 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C1561540 C0024031 C0030247 C2024831 C0243161 C2707291 C2707292 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0040132 C0040134 C2228489 C0076638 C0117002 C0006826 C0260515 C0030193 C1882272 C2598155 C0022742 C3540738 C1705179 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0600109 C0558080 C0947630 C0446516 ", "concepts": "Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Complementary and Alternative Medical Therapy, Low Back Pain, pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
