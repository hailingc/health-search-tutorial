{"text": "TITLE:\n      Nocturnal Breathing and Sleep in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Staying at Altitude\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether nocturnal breathing and sleep of patients\n      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are disturbed during a stay at moderate\n      altitude.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This randomized cross-over trial evaluates the hypothesis that patients with chronic\n      obstructive pulmonary disease experience nocturnal hypoxemia, periodic breathing and sleep\n      disturbances when staying at moderate altitude. Sleep studies and clinical evaluations will\n      be performed during 2 days in Zurich (490 m, low altitude baseline) and during 2 days at\n      Davos Clavadel (1650 m), and 2 days at Davos Jakobshorn (2590 m).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), GOLD grade 2-3\n          -  residents at low altitude (<800 m)\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Unstable condition, COPD exacerbation\n          -  Mild (GOLD 1) or very severe COPD (GOLD 4)\n          -  requirement for oxygen therapy at low altitude residence\n          -  hypoventilation\n          -  pulmonary hypertension\n          -  more than mild or unstable cardiovascular disease\n          -  use of drugs that affect respiratory center drive\n          -  internal, neurologic or psychiatric disease that interfere with protocol compliance\n             including current heavy smoking (>20 cigarettes per day), inability to perform 6 min\n             walk test.\n          -  previous intolerance to moderate altitude (<2600m).\n          -  Exposure to altitudes >1500m for >2 days within the last 4 weeks before the study.\n          -  Pregnant or nursing patients\n", "cuis": "C0024117 C0600260 C0035203 C0004048 C2015926 C1649428 C0037313 C0723362 C0013144 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0947630 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C0220825 C0024117 C0730604 C0494659 C0730607 C0730605 C1277261 C1303174 C1272221 C0865800 C0420047 C1273971 C3714496 C3244202 C3838076 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C1649428 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0018792 C1313952 C0024115 C0455540 C0034072 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0700292 C0037313 C0013144 C0424522 C0162701 C0220825 C1261322 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C1649428 C3272565 C1550472 C1649428 C0728774 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0024117 C0730604 C0494659 C0730607 C0730605 C1277261 C1303174 C1272221 C0865800 C0420047 C1273971 C3714496 C3244202 C3838076 C0687696 C0018026 C1550472 C1649428 C0243161 C0740304 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0443343 C1513302 C1547225 C0018026 C4050419 C0184633 C1546419 C0418996 C1960973 C1550472 C0000916 C0417648 C3203358 C0020542 C1963220 C1868851 C0152171 C3203102 C3807623 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0558373 C0849932 C0264656 C0042373 C0443343 C0035216 C0001721 C2237113 C0013227 C0013126 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0012634 C0018609 C1548428 C3526598 C3714738 C0376405 C3244072 C1561538 C3845546 C0392366 C0456984 C0231199 C1744706 C1547317 C0220929 C0231197 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C1649428 C0274281 C0332157 C2220266 C0947630 C0549206 C0028678 ", "concepts": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, breathing, Breathing in, breathing, Altitude, Sleep, Sleep, Sleepy, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary in breathing, Breathing, breathing, Rebreathing, study, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep, Evaluate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (diagnosis), Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, End stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, At risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease monitoring, asthma with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease follow-up, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of horses, certified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease susceptibility, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate Altitude description, prescription, prescription Atrial periodic breathing, pulmonary diseases, pulmonary disease, heart pulmonary disease, experience, experience, Inexperience, hypoxemia, sleeps, sleepy, Asleep Sleep studies, Evaluation, Evaluation, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate, Altitude, Clinical low, Altitude, Vaseline criteria, Eligibility Criteria chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (diagnosis), Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, End stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, At risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease monitoring, asthma with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease follow-up, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of horses, certified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease susceptibility, grade 2, gold low, Altitude Criteria COPD exacerbation, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, Unstable Mild, Mild, gold, Very severe oxygen therapies, Oxygen therapy, LT oxygen therapy, Home oxygen therapy, low, High altitude residence, High altitude residence hypoventilation Pulmonary hypertension, NOS, Pulmonary hypertension, Portopulmonary hypertension, pulmonary primary hypertension, Primary pulmonary hypertension, Pulmonary hypertension, mild CVD -
