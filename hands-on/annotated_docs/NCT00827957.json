{"text": "TITLE:\n      Comparing Therapeutic Hypothermia Using External and Internal Cooling for Post-Cardiac Arrest Patients\nSUMMARY:\n      Controlled therapeutic hypothermia is a method of preserving neurological function\n      post-resuscitation.It has been associated with improved functional recovery and reduced\n      histological deficits in animal models of cardiac arrest.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Three randomized clinical studies have been reported showing improved neurological outcome\n      and reduced mortality in post-resuscitation patients treated with hypothermia compared to\n      controls. Of the various methods of inducing hypothermia, internal cooling using an\n      endovascular catheter and external cooling using gel pads with a water based circulating\n      system have shown the most promise. There have not been any studies looking at outcomes\n      between the two methods of cooling.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          1. Sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest, for more\n             than 30 min\n          2. Patients aged between 18 to 80 years.\n          3. Patients who are hemodynamically stable, with a systolic BP > 90 mmHg with or without\n             inotropic support.\n          4. Patients comatose or unresponsive post-resuscitation\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          1. Hypotension despite fluid and/or vasopressor support\n          2. Positive pregnancy test in women below 50 years\n          3. Premorbid status bedbound and uncommunicative\n", "cuis": "C0020674 C0020548 C0018790 C1548801 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0020672 C0413252 C0020673 C1963170 C2911690 C0180112 C0031843 C1705273 C0025663 C0025664 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C2707261 C3845870 C0599766 C0035273 C2366754 C2587207 C3854420 C1561611 C0018790 C1410098 C3841758 C3540698 C3853906 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0700287 C1549114 C0684224 C0947630 C2707261 C3845870 C0206034 C1561611 C0035273 C2366754 C2587207 C3854420 C0020672 C0413252 C0020673 C1963170 C0332155 C0020672 C0413252 C0020673 C1963170 C0025663 C0025664 C3244072 C0524425 C0085590 C1704454 C1546572 C0043047 C0182158 C1548801 C0947630 C1328018 C0025663 C0025664 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0018790 C1410098 C3841758 C0005775 C1516559 C2732140 C0750197 C3842955 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0871470 C0578150 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0035273 C2366754 C2587207 C3854420 C0237284 C0241526 C0009421 C1547297 C2707410 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0243161 C0020649 C3163620 C0042397 C0016286 C0240802 C0430066 C0151865 C2071459 C0425251 ", "concepts": "Hypothermia, Therapeutic, Therapeutic Hyperthermia, Cardiac Arrest, External, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary hypothermic, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, Controlled, Controller, function, Function, method, methods, Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic, Neurological, ICU.neurological functional recovery, resuscitation, Nb resuscitation, For resuscitation, Autoresuscitation, Improved cardiac arrest, NB cardiac arrest, Yes, cardiac arrest, animals, model description, prescription, prescription Reported, Unreported, Reported, studies, Neurological, ICU.neurological, randomized clinical trial, Improved resuscitation, Nb resuscitation, For resuscitation, Autoresuscitation, hypothermic, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, untreated hypothermic, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, methods, methods, internalId endovascular, Catheter, Catheter, Catheter, water, pads, External studies, Therex methods, methods criteria, Eligibility Criteria cardiac arrest, NB cardiac arrest, Yes, cardiac arrest, circulations, Circulation, Sustain, Sustained VT <30 min Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient systolic BP, Hemodynamically stable, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient resuscitation, Nb resuscitation, For resuscitation, Autoresuscitation, unresponsive, unresponsiveness, comatose, Comatose, Comatose, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient Criteria hypotension, Hypotension, vasopressor, fluids Positive pregnancy test, Sensitive pregnancy test, false positive pregnancy test uncommunicative, bedbound "}
