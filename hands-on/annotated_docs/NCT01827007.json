{"text": "TITLE:\n      Assessment of Fluid Responsiveness by Elevation of PEEP in Patients With Septic Shock\nSUMMARY:\n      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether fluid responsiveness of the critically ill\n      patient can be assessed by analysing the PEEP-induced hemodynamic effects to systolic blood\n      pressure, pulse pressure, aortic blood flow, aortic time-velocity integral and left\n      ventricular end diastolic area measured with transesophageal echocardiography (PEEP-test).\n      The chances are compared to increase of CI after volume expansion (gold standard). In\n      clinical practise, it would be especially relevant if PEEP-induced changes in arterial\n      pressure variations could be used in evaluation of volume status and fluid responsiveness.\n      However, as ECHO-derived variables are used in greater extent to guide the treatment with\n      inappropriate evidence, the simultaneous registration of ECHO-derived hemodynamic\n      measurements is essential in the study design.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\u2022 Written informed consent by patient or relative\n          -  Time in ICU < 48 hours\n          -  Septic shock\n          -  Pulmonary artery catheter and radial arterial catheter\n          -  Age 18 - 75 years\n          -  Sinus rhythm\n          -  Need for norepinephrine over 0.1 ug/kg/min but otherwise hemodynamically stable i.e\n             no need to change the dose over the last 15min period before the study\n          -  Mechanical ventilation with sedation\n          -  Pwcp <18 mmHg\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Contraindication to elevation of PEEP ( elevated intracranial pressure, pulmonary\n             hypertension or other contraindication )\n          -  Contraindication to fluid challenge\n          -  Contraindication to TEE\n          -  Previous heart failure, heart valve stenosis of insufficiency\n", "cuis": "C0036983 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1261322 C2826217 C0439775 C0520886 C1546638 C0032740 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0241526 C1552616 C1706244 C0010340 C0947630 C0241526 C3553376 C0016286 C0220825 C0005768 C0229664 C0032740 C0018790 C1995642 C0949236 C0855323 C0232338 C0455822 C0455848 C0460139 C0003483 C0206054 C2022191 C4041033 C0442709 C0018827 C0032740 C0392366 C0456984 C0018026 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0032740 C3272565 C0003842 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0460139 C0241526 C3553376 C0016286 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1553384 C1514821 C1318313 C0021141 C0947630 C0423103 C2048307 C3838520 C0243161 C0013893 C0009797 C0243161 C3172260 C0036983 C0179790 C1827218 C1828314 C0007438 C0581447 C1114365 C0232201 C2041122 C0028351 C3887648 C0202145 C0772489 C0014563 C0602107 C0578150 C0025344 C0947630 C0442739 C1548568 C0199470 C0042497 C2223989 C3836859 C0235195 C0344106 C0243161 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C0524466 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0024109 C2707265 C0460139 C0032740 C0856882 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C0805586 C2347900 C2348080 C0798503 C0016286 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C0264878 C0018801 C0018802 ", "concepts": "Septic Shock, assessment, Assessment, Assessment, assessment, No Assessment, Elevation, ST Elevation, Fluid, peep, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Unresponsiveness summary, summary critically ill, study, Unresponsiveness, Poor responsiveness, fluids, Evaluate blood, blood, peep, Asystolic, Bystolic pulse pressure, high pulse pressure, blood flow, LV blood flow, RV blood flow, pressure, aortic TOE - Transesophageal echocardiography, transesophageal 2-D echocardiography, Doppler transesophageal echocardiography, end diastolic, ventricular, peep, test, test gold, standards, Standard, Standard peep, Clinical, Arterial Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, pressure, Unresponsiveness, Poor responsiveness, fluids Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment registration, Registration, Jaw registration, ADH inappropriate study, Eye measurements, ICD measurements, arm measurements criteria, Eligibility informed consent form, Criteria, Relative Septic shock Pulmonary artery catheter, Pulmonary artery catheter care, Pulmonary artery catheter removal, pulmonary artery catheterization, arterial catheter Age Sinus rhythm, sinus rhythm Norepinephrine, Norepinephrine, norepinephrine test, norepinephrine HCl, epinephrine, ethylnorepinephrine, Hemodynamically stable period, study, No change, No change Mechanical ventilation, Mechanical ventilator, mechanical ventilation rate, mechanical ventilation care, Sedation, Sedation Criteria contraindication, Contraindication, Contraindication, intracranial, elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation, pulmonary, Pulmonary, pressure, peep, elevated k contraindication, Contraindication, Contraindication, hypertension, Hypertension, Prehypertensions, No hypertension, hypertensin contraindication, Contraindication, Contraindication, challenges, Rechallenge, Dechallenge, Challenge, fluids contraindication, Contraindication, Contraindication heart valve stenosis, heart failures, Heart failure "}
