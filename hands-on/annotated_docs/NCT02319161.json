{"text": "TITLE:\n      Comparison of Calcium Channel Blockers and Beta Blockers on Tourniquet-induced Hypertension During Intravenous Regional Anesthesia\nSUMMARY:\n      The investigators aimed to investigate the efficacy of calcium channel blockers and beta\n      blockers for controlling tourniquet induced blood pressure increase in patients undergoing\n      carpal tunnel operations with IVRA. For this purpose files of patients undergoing operation\n      under IVRA were retrospectively examined in terms of demographical and hemodynamic\n      variables.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      After approval of the University Research Ethics Committee, the files of patients who have\n      been operated under intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) in orthopedics clinics between\n      January 2009 and January 2010 were retrospectively investigated. A total of 312 patients,\n      164 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and 148 patients with trigger finger have been\n      operated under IVRA. Out of 164 patients who have been operated due to carpal tunnel\n      syndrome, 50 patients in which either calcium channel blockers or beta blockers were used\n      for treatment of critical blood pressure increase after tourniquet inflation and in which\n      whole data were obtained, were included to the study.The patients with systolic blood\n      pressure above to 150 mmHg following tourniquet inflation and in which bolus dose of\n      diltiazem 10 mg (Group I) or calcium channel blocker 0.5mg/kg (Group II) have been\n      administered by intravenous route constituted the study groups. Demographical\n      characteristics and hemodynamic parameters were recorded from the patient files.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n        Patients operated due to carpal tunnel syndrome under intravenous regional anesthesia\n        betweem January 2009 and January 2010.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n        The patients that the files could not be reached\n", "cuis": "C0006684 C3536851 C0872271 C0002911 C0001645 C0550625 C0020538 C1963138 C3248638 C0947663 C0085580 C0455405 C1696708 C3829824 C0040519 C0204731 C1306522 C0085297 C1552616 C1706244 C0006684 C0872271 C0005116 C0497247 C0040519 C3244306 C0543467 C0035110 C0949626 C0007286 C0332128 C0000589 C0025638 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C2346845 C0002911 C1301914 C0007286 C3863056 C3862484 C0158328 C0007286 C0006684 C0872271 C0005116 C0001645 C0039082 C0206064 C0796095 C0796110 C2936859 C2936904 C0497247 C0040519 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1318493 C1547298 C1547308 C1551396 C0947630 C0005768 C0229664 C3245479 C0018790 C1995642 C0040519 C1511237 C1318493 C0460139 C0006684 C0872271 C0358701 C0573229 C0012373 C0441843 C2826263 C1552839 C0947630 C0449381 C0022396 C0423864 C0182913 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0007286 C3863056 C3862484 C0002911 C1301914 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0243161 ", "concepts": "Calcium Channel Blocker, Calcium Channel Blocker [EPC], Sodium Channel Blockers, Regional Anesthesia, Beta Blockers, Beta Blockers Ur, Hypertension NOS, Hypertension, Hypertension mg, Hypertensin, Hypertension NOS, FH: Hypertension, Pre-Hypertension, Has Hypertension, Tourniquet, Tourniquet on, Tourniquet on, Intravenous IG summary, summary calcium channel blocker, sodium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers bepridil blood pressure increase, tourniquet operations, operation, reoperation, Reoperation, Carpal tunnel Examined, Mexamine, Hexamine description, prescription, prescription Approval regional anesthesia, Failed regional anesthesia CTS - Carpal tunnel syndrome, left carpal tunnel syndrome, right carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger Carpal tunnel calcium channel blocker, sodium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers bepridil, beta blockers, syndrome, syndrome X, syndrome c, W syndrome, N syndrome, G syndrome blood pressure increase, tourniquet, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, inflation, Critical, Critical, Critical study, blood, blood, data, Asystolic, Bystolic tourniquet, bolus dose, inflation, pressure calcium channel blocker, sodium channel blocker, Atenolol+calcium channel blocker, calcium channel blocker overdose, diltiazem, Group I, Group ID groups, study Parameters, characteristics job, Hair characteristics, recorder criteria, Eligibility Criteria CTS - Carpal tunnel syndrome, left carpal tunnel syndrome, right carpal tunnel syndrome, regional anesthesia, Failed regional anesthesia, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient Criteria "}
