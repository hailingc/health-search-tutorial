{"text": "TITLE:\n      Management of Acute Myocardial Infarction in the Presence of Left Bundle Branch Block\nSUMMARY:\n      The primary objective of this study is to propose new treatment algorithm (strategy) for\n      patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and left bundle-branch block (LBBB).\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Current recommendations on the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) dictate urgent\n      reperfusion therapy in the case of evolving myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation\n      (STEMI). Optimal use of PCI (preferably) or thrombolysis in this situation requires a rapid\n      and correct diagnosis.\n      According to the ESC'2008 and ACC/AHA'2009 focused update guidelines patients admitted to\n      the hospital within 12 hours after the onset of chest pain with new (or presumably new) left\n      bundle-branch block (LBBB) should be treated like patients having STEMI (class I, level A).\n      However, it is well-known that in patients with concomitant LBBB, the ECG manifestations of\n      acute myocardial injury may be masked.\n      ACS may occur in a patient with \"true old\" LBBB (when doctor has/has not an ability to\n      compare the new ECG with the previous one) or (presumably) new LBBB.\n      There is a high risk of non receiving appropriate therapy or of receiving inappropriate\n      therapy (thrombolysis instead of LMWH/UFH/fondaparinux).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Age 18 - 75 years\n          -  Ischemic discomfort (ie, ischemic chest pain or equivalent) at rest \u226520 minutes\n             within previous 24 hours.\n          -  Any (new, presumably new, or old) LBBB on the prehospital (ambulance) or admission\n             ECG.\n          -  Urgent coronary angiography (followed, when indicated, by PCI), ideally within 90\n             minutes after admission\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  all-comers design\n", "cuis": "C0155626 C3541950 C0027051 C0428953 C3810814 C0155668 C3640911 C0023211 C0344420 C0006384 C0085615 C0344421 C0392148 C0376636 C1552616 C1706244 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0002045 C1553907 C0679199 C0947630 C1578513 C0023211 C0344420 C0006384 C0085615 C0344421 C0948089 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0948089 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0027051 C2926063 C0155668 C0428953 C0264708 C0155626 C1273976 C0746727 C2348362 C1168331 C0455406 C0340324 C1998297 C0340312 C0340325 C0428950 C2825159 C0035124 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0520997 C3245501 C3245502 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0612923 C0162791 C0220845 C0282423 C0184666 C0809949 C0152325 C0008031 C2926613 C1578513 C0006384 C0023211 C0344420 C0085615 C0344421 C0456387 C0518505 C0522772 C1548746 C0332155 C0023211 C3845898 C0029166 C0037285 C0746730 C0023211 C0023211 C1578513 C0087111 C0033972 C1328018 C0021141 C0520997 C1098510 C0087111 C0033972 C0019139 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1114365 C0002962 C2364135 C0234215 C0022116 C0886384 C0002422 C1547284 C0184666 C0809949 C0023211 C1578513 C0085532 C1633729 C1546403 C1546845 C1547230 C1561556 C1444656 C0184666 C0809949 C0886384 C0243161 ", "concepts": "Acute Myocardial Infarction, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Myocardial Infarctions, Myocardial Infarction, Myocardial Infarction, Old Myocardial Infarction, New Myocardial Infarction, Left Bundle-Branch Block, Left Bundle Branch Block, Bundle Branch Block, Right Bundle Branch Block, Right Bundle Branch Block, Presence, management summary, summary Objective, objective, Objective, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, algorithms, algorithm, strategy, study, new lbbb, Left bundle-branch block, bundle-branch block, Right bundle-branch block, Right bundle-branch block, Acute Coronary Syndrome description, prescription, prescription acute coronary syndrome, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment Myocardial infarction, NOS, Myocardial infarction, Healed myocardial infarction, ECG: myocardial infarction, atrial myocardial infarction, Acute myocardial infarction, First myocardial infarction, septal myocardial infarction, Septal myocardial infarction, Apical myocardial infarction, FH: Myocardial infarction, Silent myocardial infarction, Recent myocardial infarction, Lateral myocardial infarction, Aborted myocardial infarction, ECG: no myocardial infarction, Date of myocardial infarction, reperfusion therapy, elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation thrombolysis, required, required diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, correctol Guidelines, guidelines, guideline, admitted, Admitted, acc chest pain, Chest pain, new bundle-branch block, lbbb, Left bundle-branch block, Right bundle-branch block, Right bundle-branch block, class, shaving, shaving, Shaving, untreated lbbb, Uknown, manifestations oral, manifestations skin myocardial injury lbbb lbbb, new therapy, Cotherapy, Therex, ADH inappropriate thrombolysis, fondaparinux, therapy, Cotherapy, lmwh criteria, Eligibility Criteria Age ischemic chest pain, discomforts, Discomfort, Ischemia, 5 minutes ambulances, Ambulance, admissions, Admission, lbbb, new coronary angiogram, Coronary angiogram, Urgent, Urgent, Urgent, Urgent, Indicated admissions, Admission, 5 minutes Criteria "}
