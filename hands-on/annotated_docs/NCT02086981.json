{"text": "TITLE:\n      The DETEcT Study - Delirium in Elderly paTiEnts Admitted to Trauma\nSUMMARY:\n      Primary objectives are to define incidence and prevalence of Delirium in an elderly\n      population admitted to the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology and, in the\n      postoperative phase, in the high Dependency Unit as well as to determine the presence of\n      risk factors. Secondary objectives are to determine mean hospital stay, rates of\n      complications as well as in-hospital mortality and at 1-3 and 12 months after discharge,\n      functional recovery and cognitive outcomes at 1, 3 and 12 moths follow-up.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The aging of population as well as the increased life expectancy put progressively urgent\n      demands about the adequacy of the level of care provided in a hospital environment to ensure\n      clinical pathways tailored on the needs of each individual patient. On the other hand, the\n      gradual evolution of Health Care systems to care for the acute, with increasing levels of\n      specialization often technologically driven, cannot and must not neglect these aspects of\n      personalization of care protecting the elderly \"frail\" patient, because of its intrinsic\n      characteristics. In such a context, evaluation of frailty undertakes not only the meaning of\n      prevention and promotion of quality of life but it takes in account important issues for\n      patient's safety and the economic weight it entails. Delirium (acute confusional state) is a\n      complex syndrome which frequently occurs in the elderly hospitalized population. Development\n      of Delirium is associated with negative outcomes such as a longer hospital stay, a higher\n      rate of complications, cognitive and functional decline, loss of independence,\n      institutionalization, and, ultimately, death. For skilled healthcare professionals, on the\n      other hand, it represents a challenging condition because a prompt and accurate diagnosis\n      with the introduction of all those prevention and non-pharmacological measures may reduce\n      the incidence, severity and/or duration of Delirium and improve functional recovery.\n      Therefore the meaning of conducting such an observational study is also to provide evidence\n      of patients' needs and address the on-ground educational aspect for healthcare professionals\n      in a daily practice. The purposes of the study are to determine the incidence and prevalence\n      (before and after surgery) of Delirium in an elderly population admitted to the Department\n      of Orthopedics and Traumatology and in the High Dependency Unit in the postoperative phase\n      as well as to determine the risk factors for developing such a condition. Secondary\n      objectives are mean hospital stay, rates of complications as well as in-hospital mortality\n      and at 1, 3 and 12 months after discharge, functional recovery and cognitive outcomes at 1,\n      3 and 12 months follow-up.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients with any medical condition with an age of 65 years and older\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Impossibility to give an informed consent; refusal\n", "cuis": "C0011206 C0809949 C0184666 C0043251 C3263723 C3714660 C0947630 C1552616 C1706244 C0018017 C2239270 C0011206 C0439631 C0184666 C0809949 C0011546 C0439857 C0392148 C2347274 C2024161 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0018017 C2239270 C0027627 C0729829 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C1561542 C0599766 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0001811 C0034634 C3808284 C0441516 C0580931 C1555587 C0282654 C0282653 C2945812 C0018563 C0021228 C0086388 C0580931 C2948499 C0221106 C0521874 C0040399 C0013126 C0871754 C0580931 C0011551 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0449255 C0424594 C0022396 C0423864 C0518214 C2015891 C3686815 C0199176 C2981730 C1285577 C0154333 C0009676 C0011206 C0424653 C1305866 C2053618 C0701159 C0020119 C0678723 C3272564 C0243107 C0039082 C0206064 C0796095 C0796110 C2936859 C2936904 C0939261 C0011206 C1513916 C0946204 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0562230 C0021629 C0011190 C0562359 C0086388 C0011065 C1306577 C1571886 C3273187 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0018563 C0199176 C0376495 C1293116 C0599766 C0011206 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C2983285 C0947630 C1964257 C0478530 C0700325 C1555587 C0086388 C1571886 C3273187 C0424927 C0040399 C0376649 C0237607 C3245512 C0947630 C0011206 C0184666 C0809949 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0011546 C0439857 C0235146 C2347274 C2024161 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C0027627 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0018017 C2239270 C0729829 C0599766 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C1561542 C1561542 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1555709 C1948032 C0243161 C0009797 ", "concepts": "Delirium, Admitted, admitted, Traumas, Trauma, Trauma, Study summary, summary objective, objective, Delirium, Primary admitted, Admitted Dependency, Dependence, presence, Unit, postoperative VSD risk factors, risk factors, No risk factors, A/N risk factors, objective, objective, secondary, urates Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, month functional recovery description, prescription, prescription aging, raging, Decreased life expectancy demands, care, provider clinical pathways, clinical path, Uses clinical pathway, hand, individuality Health Care, care, Revolution, increasing ph neglect, spects, drive frail, care, Depersonalization Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, context, frailty, characteristics job, Hair characteristics Quality of life, quality of life, Poor quality of life, prevention, account Acute confusional state NOS, Subacute confusional state NOS, confusional state, Delirium, weight, weight, weight hospitalized, Development, Developmental, Development, development, syndrome, syndrome X, syndrome c, W syndrome, N syndrome, G syndrome, complex b Delirium, Negative loss of independence, Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, hand function institutionalization, Deinstitutionalization, institutionalized, healthcare, deaths, death, professional, professional condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, diagnosis, Diagnosis, ED diagnosis, ED diagnosis, no diagnosis, No diagnosis, Misdiagnosis, hand prevention, Reintroduction, Introduction functional recovery, Delirium, Induration, Duration, Duration, Severity study, Observational, observation, observation, provider healthcare, professional, professional, education, spect, addresses practices, practice, study Delirium, admitted, Admitted, surgery, surgery, surgery: Dependency, Dependence, High, Unit, postoperative VSD risk factors, risk factors, No risk factors, A/N risk factors, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, secondary Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, objective, objective, urates functional recovery, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, month month criteria, Eligibility Criteria condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, folder, Folder Criteria informed consent form "}
