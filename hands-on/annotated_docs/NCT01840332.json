In the follow-up of patients it is necessary to induce TSH elevation\n      to test for cancer recurrence. One of the options is to stop L-thyroxin replacement for\n      several weeks. Current pilot study aims to induce the necessary TSH elevation by decreasing\n      the L-thyroxin dose. The main hypothesis is that necessary TSH stimulation will be achieved\n      during 4-6 weeks in majority of patients.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DCT) includes surgery followed by\n      radioiodine treatment. In the follow-up of patients it is necessary to induce TSH elevation\n      for the measurement of thyreoglobulin and/or total body scanning. There are two principal\n      methods to obtain TSH elevation: 1) injection of recombinant human TSH , and 2) to stop\n      L-thyroxin replacement for several (3-4) weeks. As use of recombinant TSH is rather\n      expensive, this method is not feasible in many countries. The problem with stopping\n      L-thyroxin is development of severe hypothyroidism for several weeks with concomitant\n      symptoms and signs.\n      Current pilot study aims to induce the necessary TSH elevation by decreasing the L-thyroxin\n      dose. The main hypothesis is that necessary TSH stimulation will be achieved during 4-6\n      weeks in majority of patients with fixed dose of L-thyroxin. Concomitantly, blood tests and\n      symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism will be obtained to get information about possible\n      deviations during treatment with low dose of thyroxin.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Differentiated thyroid cancer\n          -  treated by thyroidectomy and at least 1 ablation with 131-I > 5 months ago\n          -  TSH < 4 imU/L\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Pregnancy\n          -  Known metastasis\n", "cuis": "C1337013 C1292856 C0025663 C2827714 C2828387 C1719822 C1552616 C1706244 C0007115 C0549473 C0153653 C0687150 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C1561593 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0920420 C0549379 C0278556 C0862802 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C0040165 C0683525 C0392366 C0456984 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0947630 C1292856 C1515885 C0040165 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0007115 C0549473 C0153653 C0687150 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C1561593 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0441633 C0034606 C0152338 C0337445 C1328018 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0021485 C1533685 C0444600 C0021493 C0025663 C0025664 C0392939 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C0040165 C3840617 C1535531 C0723457 C0033213 C2081614 C0025663 C0025664 C0020676 C0455486 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0040165 C1306232 C1457887 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0040165 C0947630 C1292856 C1515885 C0018941 C0040165 C0020676 C0455486 C1457887 C3242430 C1561528 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0040165 C1550472 C0014877 C0015310 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0007115 C0549473 C0153653 C0687150 C1561593 C0040145 C0079989 C0405532 C0547070 C1261381 C1561542 C0332155 C0243161 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0027627 C2939420 C2939419 C1328685 ", "concepts": "Differentiated Thyroid Cancer, Stimulation, Methods, Method, Method, Follow summary, summary Thyroid cancer, Thyroid cancer, parathyroid cancer, parathyroid cancer, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, surgery, surgery, surgery:, Undifferentiated Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation cancer recurrence, cancer recurrent, Anal cancer recurrent, Lung cancer recurrent, replacements, Replacement, placement, thyroxin, options, test, test elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation, study stimulation, Acustimulation, thyroxin description, prescription, prescription Thyroid cancer, Thyroid cancer, parathyroid cancer, parathyroid cancer, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, surgery, surgery, surgery:, Undifferentiated Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation Scanning, Scanning, body, Measurement of thyroglobulin, Therex elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation, injections, injection, Reinjection, IP injection, methods, methods, recombinant human TPO replacements, Replacement, placement, thyroxin, 3-4, Recombinant TSH stopping, problem, problem:, method, methods hypothyroidism, H/O: hypothyroidism, development, Development, Development, Development, No development, thyroxin, severed symptoms elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation, thyroxin, study stimulation, Acustimulation blood tests, thyroxin hypothyroidism, H/O: hypothyroidism, symptoms, informational, Information Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, thyroxin, low, Esodeviations, Exodeviations criteria, Eligibility Criteria Thyroid cancer, Thyroid cancer, parathyroid cancer, parathyroid cancer, Undifferentiated thyroidectomy, Parathyroidectomy, Hemithyroidectomy, Ablation, ablations, month, untreated Criteria pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
