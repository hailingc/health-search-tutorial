{"text": "TITLE:\n      Immune Response in Adults to PrEP and Simulated Booster PEP With a New CPRV\nSUMMARY:\n      Pre exposure rabies vaccination with a new Chromatographically Purified Vero-cell Rabies\n      Vaccine(SPEEDA) is as effective as Purified Vero-cell Rabies vaccine.\n      After the pre exposure rabies vaccination with a new Chromatographically Purified Vero-cell\n      Rabies Vaccine(SPEEDA), the Rabies neutralizing antibodies in all patients on day 42 are 0.5\n      IU/ml or more.\n      And Simulated post-exposure rabies booster vaccination with a new Chromatographically\n      Purified Vero-cell Rabies Vaccine(SPEEDA) is as effective as Purified Vero-cell Rabies\n      vaccine.\n      After the simulated post-exposure rabies booster vaccination with a new Chromatographically\n      Purified Vero-cell Rabies Vaccine(SPEEDA), the Rabies neutralizing antibodies in all\n      patients on day 14 after the booster are 0.5 IU/ml or more.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Pre-exposure vaccination will be done according to standard protocol. Participants will be\n      injected with one dose on day 0, 7 and 28. Blood samples will be taken on day 0, 28 and 42\n      after the first vaccination dose.\n      360 days later, participants will receive simulated post-exposure rabies booster vaccination\n      one dose on day 0 and 3. Blood samples will be taken again on day 0(360 days) and 14(374\n      days) after the booster vaccination.\n      Rabies neutralizing antibody levels will be measured by Rapid Fluorescent Focus Inhibition\n      Test(RFFIT). And the levels of 0.5 IU/ml or more is considered acceptable protective level.\n      For statistical analysis, percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion (defined as RNab \u2265\n      0.5 IU/ mL) are determine at each sampling time. The average of the titer used in this study\n      is Geometric mean titer(GMT). 95 percent confidence interval(95% CI) of the GMT will be\n      calculated for each study group from individual measurements of serum rabies antibody levels\n      at each sampling time. One-way ANOVA would be used to calculated the significance of the\n      difference between the GMT of three groups, SPEEDA\u00ae intradermal injection, SPEEDA\u00ae\n      intramuscular injection and PVRV intramuscular injection. The primary criterion for this\n      comparison are the rabies antibody value on day 42 (2 weeks after the third vaccine dose of\n      pre-exposure vaccination) and on day 374(2 weeks after the first vaccine dose of booster\n      vaccination). Results will be deemed statistically significant at p < 0.05. Safety data\n      (immediate, local and systemic reactions) were summarized as numbers and percentages.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Healthy\n          -  Can visit
