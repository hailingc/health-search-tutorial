{"text": "TITLE:\n      X-Ray Computed Tomography and Blood Reactive Oxygen Species Level\nSUMMARY:\n      The clinically widely used X-ray computed tomography examination has a low-grade radiation\n      effect and recently has attracted much attention concerning the possible adverse effects of\n      radiation on human body [ref. 1-5]. The radiation is harmful to human tissues and cells\n      mainly because it can interact with water (which makes up to 80% of cells) to generate\n      reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the formation of hydroxyl radicals. So far as we\n      can reach, there is no report concerning the relation between X-ray computed tomography\n      examination and the blood ROS concentration. Therefore, we wish to conduct this study to\n      clarify if the routinely applied X-ray computed tomography examination may induce a higher\n      concentration of ROS in the peripheral blood.\n      Study subjects will be participants of health check program at our hospital. The only\n      enrollment condition will be a scheduled X-ray computed tomography examination for either\n      lung (20 cases) or heart (20 cases) of the study subject. Another 20 participants receiving\n      health check program without X-ray computed tomography examination will be included as the\n      control group. The formal consent will be delivered to the participants of health check\n      program several days before their admission for health check and will be retrieved before\n      the proceeding of health check.\n      Measurements and comparison of ROS concentration will be performed in the sampled peripheral\n      blood before and after the performance of X-ray computed tomography examination during a\n      regular health check program. Totally 120 blood samples will be collected from included 60\n      study subjects within 3 months. Reactive oxygen species\uff08ROS\uff09levels will be measured by a\n      chemiluminescence (CL) analysing system (CLD-110, Tohoku Electronic Industrial, Sendai,\n      Japan).\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Participants of health check program at our hospital who will receive a scheduled\n             X-ray computed tomography examination for either lung (20 cases) or heart (20 cases).\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Those whose age are under 50 or above 70 year-olds will be excluded.\n", "cuis": "C0040405 C0936234 C2717955 C2698635 C0030054 C0184633 C2359957 C0134413 C0229664 C0851353 C2946261 C1552616 C1706244 C0040405 C0412643 C2181323 C0008794 C0860888 C0031809 C0582103 C1306645 C1962945 C3891450 C0885876 C3244287 C0286840 C1550472 C1522449 C1524020 C1963223 C0879626 C0559546 C0853204 C0004268 C0424101 C0152338 C1522449 C1524020 C1963223 C0043047 C0011164 C0030054 C0184633 C1561528 C0040405 C0412643 C2181323 C0008794 C0860888 C0684224 C0700287 C1306645 C1962945 C3891450 C0885876 C0233492 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C0031809 C0582103 C0005768 C0229664 C0947630 C0040405 C0412643 C2181323 C0008794 C0860888 C0031809 C0582103 C1306645 C1962945 C3891450 C0885876 C0229664 C0425710 C2238079 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C0947630 C0260860 C0040405 C0412643 C2181323 C0008794 C0860888 C0031809 C0582103 C3888021 C1516879 C0012634 C3864998 C0009647 C0871117 C1306645 C1962945 C3891450 C0885876 C0086960 C0018787 C0947630 C0024109 C0040405 C0412643 C2181323 C0008794 C0860888 C0031809 C0582103 C1306645 C1962945 C3891450 C0885876 C0260860 C0260860 C1552839 C0308779 C0184666 C0809949 C0260860 C3845714 C0260860 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C0441621 C3843236 C3843237 C3843238 C3843239 C0040405 C0412643 C2181323 C0008794 C0860888 C0031809 C0582103 C0005768 C0229664 C1306645 C1962945 C3891450 C0885876 C0178913 C0260860 C0030054 C0184633 C0947630 C1561542 C1553181 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0086960 C0260860 C0040405 C0412643 C2181323 C0008794 C0860888 C0031809 C0582103 C1306645 C1962945 C3891450 C0885876 C0018787 C0024109 C0243161 C1561543 C1552867 ", "concepts": "X-Ray Computer Assisted Tomography, X-Ray Computed Tomography Scanners, 4D Computed Tomography, Species, Oxygen, Oxygen, Oxygen, Oxygent, Blood, Blood, Level summary, summary computerized tomography, computed tomography of hip, computed tomography of arm, cine computed tomography, computed tomography spiral, examinations, Examination, X-rays, X-ray, X-ray, X-rays, grade, gradex, low, Radiation, Radiation, Radiation adverse effects, adverse effect, No adverse effect, attention, Inattention body, Radiation, Radiation, Radiation water, degenerate oxygen, oxygen, Information computerized tomography, computed tomography of hip, computed tomography of arm, cine computed tomography, computed tomography spiral, reports, reports, X-rays, X-ray, X-ray, X-rays, elation concentrations, Concentration, Hemoconcentration, Hemoconcentration, examinations, Examination, blood, blood, study computerized tomography, computed tomography of hip, computed tomography of arm, cine computed tomography, computed tomography spiral, examinations, Examination, X-rays, X-ray, X-ray, X-rays peripheral blood, peripheral blood flow, peripheral blood smear, concentrations, Concentration, Hemoconcentration, Hemoconcentration Study, health checkup computerized tomography, computed tomography of hip, computed tomography of arm, cine computed tomography, computed tomography spiral, examinations, Examination, enrollment, Enrollment, condition, Condition, conditioning, precondition, X-rays, X-ray, X-ray, X-rays, schedule heart, study, lung computerized tomography, computed tomography of hip, computed tomography of arm, cine computed tomography, computed tomography spiral, examinations, Examination, X-rays, X-ray, X-ray, X-rays, health checkup health checkup, groups, deliver admissions, Admission, health checkup, Several days health checkup concentrations, Concentration, Hemoconcentration, Hemoconcentration, sampled, Measurement 4, Measurement 3, Measurement 2, Measurement 1 computerized tomography, computed tomography of hip, computed tomography of arm, cine computed tomography, computed tomography spiral, examinations, Examination, blood, blood, X-rays, X-ray, X-ray, X-rays blood samples, health checkup oxygen, oxygen, study, month Immunochemiluminescence criteria, Eligibility Criteria schedule, health checkup computerized tomography, computed tomography of hip, computed tomography of arm, cine computed tomography, computed tomography spiral, examinations, Examination, X-rays, X-ray, X-ray, X-rays, heart, lung Criteria year, exclude "}
