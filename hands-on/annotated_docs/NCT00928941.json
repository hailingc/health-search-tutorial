{"text": "TITLE:\n      Neural Correlates of Cognitive Rehabilitation in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\nSUMMARY:\n      Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an emotional disorder that can also lead to\n      problems with attention and memory. Cognitive training has been successfully used to improve\n      attention and processing speed in other patient populations as well as healthy elderly. The\n      purpose of this study is to examine how effective cognitive training will be in Veterans\n      with PTSD.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      1. Objective(s) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been established as relatively\n           common in a significant number of OEF/OIF Veterans (Vasterling & Brailey, 2005; Hoge et\n           al., 2008). Attention deficits, which are prominent in PTSD, may be due to difficulty\n           sustaining attention over time and encoding or getting information into storage which\n           leads to reduced attention and memory scores on neuropsychological measures.\n           Disruptions in attention are common in many types of neurological and psychiatric\n           disorders. Deficient attentional skills may negatively affect cognitive performance in\n           other areas (e.g., memory, planning) and thereby reduce effectiveness navigating daily\n           life tasks as well as decrease the Veteran's life satisfaction after returning home.\n           The origin of the attention impairment may be amenable to sophisticated remediation\n           approaches using a \"bottom up, neuroscience based\" visual training program (i.e., Posit\n           Science, Inc. cognitive rehabilitation program), which has been successful in improving\n           neurocognitive function in healthy older adults (e.g., Mahncke et al., 2006) and\n           patients with Schizophrenia (e.g., Bell at al., 2008). By engaging Veterans with PTSD\n           in targeted remediation, it is expected that both behavioral (seen in\n           neuropsychological test gains) and neural activity (e.g., BOLD response through fMRI)\n           will reflect the improvement and this may be linked to improved outcomes in daily\n           functioning.\n        2. Research Design: The longitudinal research design for this project will be a three\n           factor mixed factorial design with between subject factors of PTSD (+PTSD x -PTSD) and\n           cognitive remediation [cogrem x video game] and within subject variable of time tested\n           (pre-training, post-training, 3 month follow up). There will be 40 participants\n           enrolled in the following groups of 10 each: 1) +PTSD/cogrem, 2) +PTSD/video game, 3)\n           -PTSD/cogrem, and 4) -PTSD/video game. PTSD status is determined by a diagnosis of PTSD\n           identified through a clinical interview for DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD. The\n           active treatment is cognitive training. Veterans in this group will receive the Posit\n           Science (Mahncke et al., 2006) visual cognitive remediation paradigm of 40 hours of\n           training. The control treatment is a video game designed by Nintendo for the DS\n           handheld system, which intended to improve mental functioning called Brain Age\n           (Nintendo, Inc.) which will be played for 40 hours. Groups will be compared on the\n           difference scores for neuropsychological, neurobehavioral and neuroimaging data to see\n           if there is a benefit in cognitive training and if that benefit is greater in the group\n           with PTSD.\n        3. Methodology: Forty outpatient Veterans will be enrolled. All individuals will receive a\n           neurobehavioral interview, neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging at the baseline\n           visit, post training and at follow-up visits. After the baseline visit, each volunteer\n           will be randomized to one of two conditions.\n        4. Findings: This is a new study and there are no findings to date.\n        5. Clinical Relationships: This study will examine the effects of a standard cognitive\n           rehabilitation program with OEF/OIF veterans who have cognitive deficits due to PTSD.\n        6. This project will impact veterans' healthcare by identifying cognitive problems in PTSD\n           and will test the ability of a rehabilitation program to remediate those problems.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  OEF/OIF Veteran,\n          -  meets DSM-IV criteria for PTSD,\n          -  control group does not meet criteria for PTSD\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  prior history of significant head injury (LOC > 30 minutes) or other neurological\n             disorder (e.g., stroke, seizure, multiple sclerosis), learning disability or\n             confirmed diagnosis of ADHD,\n          -  contraindication to MR imaging, failed malingering tests during testing, or a history\n             of severe mental illness (i.e., Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder)\n          -  individuals will be excluded if in the 30 days prior to the initial interview if\n             they:\n               -  do not have stable housing (i.e., staying in same residence),\n               -  have medication changes or have had a psychiatric hospitalization,\n          -  participants who meet DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence will be excluded

and at 3 month follow up);\n             participants who test positive for alcohol or recent substance use (e.g.,\n             methamphetamine) or report significant levels of drug or alcohol use if
