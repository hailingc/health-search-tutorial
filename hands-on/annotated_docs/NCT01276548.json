Subjects who aged 18 years or older\n          2. Subjects whose written informed consent was obtained complying with the local\n             regulatory requirements prior to their participation in the trial\n          3. Subjects who have histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or\n             metastatic epithelial cancer of the exocrine pancreas. High-quality contrast-enhanced\n             CT scanning is required to evaluate resectability. Measurable disease is not\n             required.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          1. Subjects who have received prior radiation therapy (XRT) for pancreatic cancer unless\n             progression was documented after XRT and 6 weeks have elapsed between completion of\n             XRT and start of trial medication.\n          2. Subjects who have had systemic treatment such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy, for\n             pancreatic cancer. However, prior use of chemotherapy, e.g. 5-FU or capecitabine, for\n             radiation sensitization is allowed. If gemcitabine was given in the adjuvant setting,\n             only subjects relapsed with cancer after 6 months of completing the last dose of\n             gemcitabine can participate in the trial.\n          3. Subjects who have had a major surgery within 2 weeks prior to the screening/baseline\n             visit\n", "cuis": "C0009429 C0556895 C1140680 C1882206 C0079083 C0591953 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0220825 C1171549 C1966209 C1552616 C1706244 C0009429 C0556895 C0220825 C0947630 C0079083 C0591953 C1171549 C1140680 C1882206 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1555709 C1948032 C0009797 C1553903 C0018792 C1519810 C3842359 C2349568 C0553695 C1280431 C2985477 C0022131 C0496784 C0496872 C1283884 C0006826 C0260515 C0235146 C1328685 C0449900 C1507248 C0009924 C0441633 C0034606 C3245501 C3245502 C1619636 C0012634 C0018609 C0220825 C3245501 C3245502 C1619636 C0243161 C0279134 C0034619 C1522449 C0235974 C0346647 C0030297 C0280222 C0242656 C1301725 C1609436 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C1552850 C0018792 C0021083 C0392920 C3665472 C0013216 C0580690 C0013218 C2717829 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0235974 C0346647 C0030297 C0280222 C0392920 C3665472 C0013216 C0580690 C0013218 C2717829 C0671970 C0016360 C1325847 C0178702 C0595957 C3839736 C0035405 C0354899 C3839712 C0045093 C3244317 C1522449 C1524020 C1963223 C0001551 C3887804 C0006826 C0260515 C0277556 C1561542 C0045093 C0018792 C0679637 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0728774 C1512346 ", "concepts": "Combination Therapy, Combination therapy, Ovarian Cancer, pM0 Ovarian Cancer, Carboplatin, Carboplat, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Evaluate, Genexol, Triall summary, summary Combination Therapy, Combination therapy, Evaluate, study Carboplatin, Carboplat, Genexol Ovarian Cancer, pM0 Ovarian Cancer, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment criteria, Eligibility Criteria folder, Folder informed consent form regulatory requirement, Atrial unresectable, Other malignancy confirmed histologicaly or cytologically, AIN I and II (histologically confirmed) exocrine pancreas, Exocrine pancreas, exocrine pancreas cell, endocrine pancreas, Endocrine pancreas, Endocrine pancreas, Endocrine pancreas, cancers, cancer, High, metastat, contrasted, W contrast, Contrast Scanning, Scanning, required, required, Required, disease, h disease, Evaluate required, required, Required Criteria prior radiation therapy, radiation therapy, radiation therapy, pancreatic cancer, pancreatic cancer, tumor pancreatic cancer, stage pancreatic cancer progression, Documented, Documented, document, document, document Medications, medication:, medications:, Premedication, IV medication, Medications, Medications, start, Atrial immunotherapy, Chemotherapy, Chemotherapy, Chemotherapy, TB chemotherapy, polychemotherapy, Polychemotherapy, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment pancreatic cancer, pancreatic cancer, tumor pancreatic cancer, stage pancreatic cancer, Chemotherapy, Chemotherapy, Chemotherapy, TB chemotherapy, polychemotherapy, Polychemotherapy, capecitabine, 5-fu sensitization, desensitizations, desensitization, Sensitization, rh sensitization, Hyposensitization, Allosensitization, gemcitabine, given, Radiation, Radiation, Radiation, Adjuvant, upsetting cancers, cancer, relapse, month gemcitabine, Atrial major surgery, screening, Screening, screening, screening, Screening, Vaseline visit "}
