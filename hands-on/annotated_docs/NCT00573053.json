{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effects of Targeting Lower Arterial Oxygen Saturations on the Development of Control of Breathing in Very Preterm Infants\nSUMMARY:\n      To determine whether targeting lower arterial oxygen saturations from the day of birth\n      alters the early (first 3 months) postnatal development of the control of ventilation and\n      the hypercapnic and hyperoxic responses in very preterm infants.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      To measure the effects of baseline oxygenation in extremely low birth weight preterm infants\n      on:\n      i) The early (first 5 breaths) and late or steady state (3-5 minutes) ventilatory response\n      to CO2 ii) The immediate (< 1 minute) ventilatory response to hyperoxia iii) The PCO2 apneic\n      threshold iv) The breathing pattern during quiet and REM sleep v) The morphology of periodic\n      breathing cycles vi) The incidence and morphology of sighs\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Gestational age 23 0/7 - 27 6/7 weeks\n          -  Enrolled in the COT trial at the Health Sciences Centre and the St. Boniface General\n             Hospital in Winnipeg\n          -  Postnatal age between 21 days and 70 days\n          -  Informed written consent obtained from at least one of the parents.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Need for mechanical ventilation, NCPAP or O2\n          -  Sepsis or other known causes of apnea.\n", "cuis": "C0020119 C0678723 C3272564 C0243107 C0035203 C0004048 C2015926 C0003842 C0728976 C1564718 C0030054 C0184633 C2359957 C0134413 C1548802 C1254042 C1552616 C1706244 C0030054 C0184633 C0005615 C1550722 C3245487 C1561538 C0746961 C0678723 C1254042 C0003842 C1135598 C0035203 C2945579 C1561542 C0020440 C0021294 C0728731 C1704632 C0242706 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0456065 C3665963 C0021294 C0728731 C0412792 C0728774 C0886384 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0087153 C1611144 C2262749 C1697779 C0391839 C0087153 C1611144 C0886384 C0517967 C0700329 C0037322 C0234451 C0031082 C1706381 C0700329 C0004048 C0035203 C2015926 C1441722 C0425481 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1148461 C2053598 C2721658 C3812897 C3891294 C0183644 C1328956 C2718080 C0018792 C3842337 C0557110 C0811741 C0243161 C0199470 C2223989 C3836859 C0042497 C2223988 C2228926 C2223979 C0036690 C0243026 C0003578 C3845898 ", "concepts": "Development, Maturation, Development, development, breathing, Breathing in, breathing, Arterial, Control, Controlip, Oxygen, Oxygen, Oxygen, Oxygent, Lower, Maturation summary, summary oxygen, oxygen, births, birth, birth, day, Desaturation, Maturation, Maturation, Arterial postnatal development, ventilation, Ventilation, month hypercapnic, Preterm infant, Preterm infant, response, hyperoxia description, prescription, prescription Extremely low birth weight infant, Extremely low birth weight baby, Preterm infant, Preterm infant, Preoxygenation, Vaseline 5 minutes, Response, Response, Response, ventilators, Ventilator response to hyperoxia, immediate, pco2, ventilators, Ventilator, 5 minute breathing pattern, morphology, REM sleep, NREM sleep, periodical, Periodic morphology, in breathing, Breathing, breathing, Rebreathing, sighs criteria, Eligibility Criteria Gestational age, gestational age, Gestational age test General, General, cot, eHealth, mHealth, Atrial 0 days Age of parents, Obtain informed written consent Criteria Mechanical ventilation, NOS, mechanical ventilation rate, mechanical ventilation care, mechanical ventilators, mechanical ventilation volume, mechanical ventilation weaning, mode of mechanical ventilation Sepsis, Sepsis, apnea, Uknown "}
