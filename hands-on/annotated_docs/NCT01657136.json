{"text": "TITLE:\n      Ivabradine Versus Beta-blockers in the Treatment of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia\nSUMMARY:\n      The aim of this study is to prospectively compare the effectiveness and safety of ivabradine\n      and beta-blockers in the treatment of inappropriate sinus tachycardia.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a non-paroxysmal arrhythmia, characterized by a\n      persistently high sinus heart rate (HR) and/or an exaggerated HR response to minimal\n      exertion, and can be responsible for palpitations, asthenia, chest pain, dizziness and\n      syncope, which can be highly invalidating. Conventional treatment of IST, targeted to\n      symptoms control, mainly consists on \u03b2-blockers. However, these drugs are often insufficient\n      or not well tolerated because of side effects (mostly hypotension) that usually limit the\n      administered dose. Ivabradine, a sinus rate lowering agent currently employed in Europe in\n      the treatment of stable angina and chronic heart failure, has recently been demonstrated to\n      be effective and safe in the treatment of IST by a few case reports and clinical trials. A\n      randomized clinical trial comparing ivabradine to \u03b2-blockers has not be performed yet.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (HR >100 bpm at rest ECG and/or medium Holter ECG HR\n             >90 bpm)\n          -  Age > 18 years;\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Secondary causes of sinus tachycardia;\n          -  Structural heart diseases,\n          -  Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;\n          -  Sinus nodal reentrant tachycardia;\n          -  Contraindications to beta-blockers;\n          -  Administration of beta-blockers, non-di-hydropiridinic calcium channels antagonists,\n             class I and III anti-arrhythmic drugs or digitalis at the time of enrollment;\n          -  Age < 18 years;\n          -  Inability of giving informed consent;\n", "cuis": "C4048808 C0257190 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0439096 C1552616 C1706244 C0257190 C0947630 C0039239 C2108109 C1963246 C1960154 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0001645 C0021141 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C1881170 C0919605 C0018810 C2041121 C2197023 C0488794 C3845990 C1704632 C1706817 C2911692 C0030252 C3160712 C0425596 C1273518 C0008031 C2926613 C0012833 C0042571 C1963093 C0015264 C0239313 C0004093 C0947912 C3714552 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0039070 C1457887 C0013227 C0020649 C3163620 C0163170 C0879626 C0257190 C0557351 C0041674 C1820370 C0264716 C0018802 C0340288 C0002965 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1096775 C0007320 C0085973 C3853626 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0206034 C0257190 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1881170 C1114365 C0243161 C0039239 C2108109 C1963246 C1960154 C0027627 C0018799 C1299624 C0039231 C3827868 C0428977 C0723346 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C0001645 C1533734 C0725057 C0376495 C3845829 C0001563 C0036589 C0455708 C1534841 C2360550 C0006675 C0001645 C0381385 C3888021 C1516879 C0304520 C0058012 C0456387 C0013227 C0003195 C3537142 C1114365 C0009797 ", "concepts": "Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia, Ivabradine, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Beta summary, summary ivabradine, study sinus; tachycardia, Sinus tachycardia, Sinus tachycardia, ECG sinus tachycardia, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, beta-blocker, ADH inappropriate description, prescription, prescription Inappropriate sinus tachycardia, paroxysmal arrhythmia Heart rate, heart rate, heart rate, Heart rate, No heart rate, Response, Response, Response palpitations, Palpitations, No palpitations, responsible, chest pain, Chest pain, Dizziness, dizziness, Dizziness, exertion, exertional, Asthenia, Myasthenia, asthenic Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, syncope symptoms, drugs hypotension, Hypotension, hypotensin, side effect Ivabradine, employed, Unemployed, flowering Chronic heart failure, Chronic heart failure, stable angina, Unstable angina, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment clinical trials, case report, case report, Case report, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment randomized clinical trial, ivabradine criteria, Eligibility Criteria Inappropriate sinus tachycardia Age Criteria sinus; tachycardia, Sinus tachycardia, Sinus tachycardia, ECG sinus tachycardia, secondary heart diseases Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Tachycardias, Tachycardia, brachycardia, Sinus contraindication, Contraindication, Contraindication, beta-blocker Administration, Administration Set, Readministration, Administrative, Oral Administration, Self Administration, Administration type, Administration note, Administration note, calcium, beta-blocker, antagonist G enrollment, Enrollment, digitalis, digitalin, class, drugs, Anti-arrhythmic, Anti-arrhythmic Age informed consent form "}
