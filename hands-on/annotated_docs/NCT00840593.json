{"text": "TITLE:\n      A Prospective, Randomised Long-term Follow-up of Operative Versus Non-operative Treatment of Gr. 3 Acromioclavicular Dislocation\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to compare the long-term clinical and radiological results of\n      operative and conservative treatment of Tossy type 3 acromio-clavicular dislocation.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The optimal treatment of Rockwood type 3 AC joint injuries is still controversial. This\n      controversy results from the low level of evidence of the early literature and the\n      evaluation of all AC joint injuries with a type I through III classification system.\n      There are no prospective randomized controlled long-term studies on the treatment of Tossy\n      type 3 AC dislocation using primary repair and minimal pin fixation.\n      In this study, the non-surgical treatment consisted of immobilisation of the injured\n      AC-joint in a Kenny-Howard-type splint for four weeks. The surgical treatment consisted of\n      an open reduction and fixation of the AC joint with two smooth Kirschner wires (2 mm in\n      diameter) across the AC-joint. The K-wires were bent at the proximal ends, with suturing of\n      the superior AC ligament.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patient with Tossy grade 3 AC-dislocation was recruited between the years 1989 and\n             1991 at Kuopio University Hospital for a randomized controlled study\n          -  A written informed consent.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Not written informed consent\n", "cuis": "C0012691 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C1719822 C0695640 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C3272565 C0012691 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0001209 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C3263723 C1629051 C0023866 C1550472 C0393009 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C3263723 C0444594 C0457356 C0596463 C1275491 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0947630 C0282440 C1328018 C0012691 C0185023 C0728733 C0185042 C1522662 C0043240 C0374711 C0543467 C2363849 C0020944 C0185112 C0185113 C0558653 C1262163 C0947630 C0543467 C2363849 C0038009 C0185373 C2370853 C0185023 C0728733 C0185042 C1522662 C3842089 C0086510 C0009068 C0038969 C0086510 C0225082 C1299728 C1269080 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0012691 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0687697 C0947630 C0282440 C0009797 C0243161 C0009797 ", "concepts": "Dislocation, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Follow, acromioclavicular summary, summary study, Clinical dislocation, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, acromion description, prescription, prescription Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, injuries, CT AC joint literature, low, levels of evidence Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, injuries, Gass classification, Kiel classification, drug classification, nyha classification Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, studies, randomized controlled trial, Therex dislocation, Fixation, fixations, Refixation, Fixation, repairs, repairs surgical treatment, Non-surgical treatment, immobilisations, mobilisation, Remobilisation, Bone immobilisation, Limb immobilisation, study surgical treatment, Non-surgical treatment, splint open reduction, Open reduction, Fixation, fixations, Refixation, Fixation, 2 mm, Kirschner wire suturing, Suturing, K-wire V ligament, T-ligament, Ligament criteria, Eligibility Criteria dislocation, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, grade 3 study, randomized controlled trial informed consent form Criteria informed consent form "}
