{"text": "TITLE:\n      Effects of Pain on Driving Performance and Cognition.\nSUMMARY:\n      It has been suggested that cognitive functioning is impaired in chronic pain patients. Since\n      most of these pain patients engage in daily activities including driving, it was\n      hypothezised that they may have an increased risk of becoming involved in traffic accidents.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Most chronic pain patients engage in daily activities including driving. Driving a car is a\n      complex task requiring mental alertness and a variety of cognitive functions such as\n      perception, attention, learning, memory and decision making.Several studies have\n      demonstrated cognitive impairments on laboratory tasks in patients with chronic pain,\n      particularly on measures assessing attentional capacity, processing speed and psychomotor\n      speed. These findings suggest that car driving performance might be impaired, and that\n      chronic pain patients may therefore have an increased traffic accident risk. Unfortunately,\n      no studies have investigated the impact of chronic pain on actual driving ability. The\n      present study was designed to investigate the effects of chronic pain on actual driving\n      performance during normal traffic. In addition to the on-the-road driving test, psychomotor,\n      and memory tests measuring driving-related skills were conducted in the laboratory.\n      Moreover, effects of pain on an attentional capacity test were tested using event-related\n      potentials.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n        age driving licence driving experience normal vision right-handed fluently Dutch speaking\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n        psychological or physical disorder drug or alcohol abuse psychotropic medication use\n        excessive smoking, drinking\n", "cuis": "C0009240 C4050139 C0030193 C1882272 C2598155 C1552616 C1706244 C0392334 C0392335 C2237115 C2237374 C0150055 C0744939 C2239122 C2004436 C0030193 C0425152 C0000932 C0221706 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0150055 C0744939 C2239122 C2004436 C4050139 C0425152 C0392335 C2237115 C0392334 C2237374 C2371932 C2266643 C0549164 C0939261 C0011109 C0030971 C0234426 C4062886 C0004268 C0424101 C0023185 C0557900 C0679065 C0947630 C0025260 C0700327 C0338656 C1270972 C0150055 C0744939 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C0582591 C0004268 C0577356 C2926606 C0000932 C0221706 C0150055 C0744939 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C0150055 C0744939 C0947630 C0150055 C0744939 C0947630 C1553386 C0392366 C0456984 C0025260 C0700327 C0392366 C3850116 C0233492 C0445356 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C0392366 C0228018 C0030193 C0456984 C0233492 C0445356 C0004268 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0234622 C3665386 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0421231 C2960399 C0015726 C0423899 C1261259 C1510508 C0243161 C0683323 C0240320 C1306597 C0848372 C0085762 C0013227 C1254351 C0033978 C0684271 ", "concepts": "Cognition, Driving, Pain, Pain, Pain summary, summary cognitive functioning, Cognitive functions, cognitive functions, no cognitive function, chronic pain, chronic pain hip activities, activities:, pain, engaged traffic accidents, Road traffic accident, CK increased, LH increased, PT increased, QT increased, pH increased, GH increased, increased mg, CI increased, Na increased, K+ increased, Zn increased, T4 increased, T3 increased description, prescription, prescription chronic pain, chronic pain hip, activities, activities:, Driving, engaged Cognitive functioning, cognitive functions, cognitive functioning, no cognitive function, Basic cognitive functions, cognitive functions memory, mental alertness, complex b decision making, perception, Apperception, Misperception, attention, Inattention, Learning, learning, relearning, studies, memory, memory cognitive impairments, Mild cognitive impairment, chronic pain, chronic pain hip, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory Processing speed, attention car driving, Findings traffic accident, Road traffic accident, chronic pain, chronic pain hip, CK increased, LH increased, PT increased, QT increased, pH increased, GH increased, increased mg, CI increased, Na increased, K+ increased, Zn increased, T4 increased, T3 increased chronic pain, chronic pain hip, studies chronic pain, chronic pain hip, study normal, test, test memory, memory, tests, Etests, elated, Unrelated, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory test, teste, pain, test, elated, Unrelated, attention criteria, Eligibility Criteria normal vision, Abnormal vision, experience, experience, Inexperience, Driving licence, Has driving licence, Fright, Bright, wright, Wright Criteria physical disorder, medication use, psychological, psychological tic, alcohol abuse, drug, drug, Psychotropic drinking "}
