{"text": "TITLE:\n      Cerebral Blood Flow Changes in People With Obesity After Glucose Consumption\nSUMMARY:\n      This study evaluates the hypothesis that a meal constituted of only glucose produces\n      differences in the brain blood flow in people with obesity that are not observed in people\n      without obesity. These changes, at least in part, could explain the mechanisms involved in\n      maintenance or development of obesity.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Live in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, S\u00e3o Paulo - Brazil.\n          -  Age between 18 and 40 years old.\n          -  Female gender.\n          -  Regular menses.\n          -  Weight inferior than 120 Kg and body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 kg/m2, for\n             the group with obesity.\n          -  BMI between 18,5 and 24,9 kg/m2, for the group without obesity.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  High blood pressure, diabetes, glucose intolerance or impaired fasting glycemia,\n             metabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism and any kidney, liver, heart or neurologic\n             disease.\n          -  Psychiatric disorders, alcoholism, smoking or illicit drug abuse.\n          -  Pregnancy or desire to be pregnant\n          -  Use of medications, excluding contraceptives.\n          -  Contraindication for magnetic resonance imaging.\n          -  Be in treatment for obesity.\n", "cuis": "C0428714 C1947907 C0028754 C1963185 C0017725 C0337438 C1552616 C1706244 C0017725 C0947630 C0232338 C0455822 C0455848 C0028754 C0006104 C0085632 C0028754 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C0028754 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1114365 C0025344 C0005893 C1305855 C0231255 C0231254 C0944911 C1305866 C3812400 C0028754 C1552839 C0028754 C1552839 C0243161 C0020538 C2926615 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0271650 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0015663 C0720371 C0524620 C1262289 C0020676 C0455486 C0022646 C0227665 C0023884 C0018787 C0012634 C0018609 C0004936 C0233514 C0851576 C0543426 C0543427 C0525045 C0086190 C0001973 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0549206 C0871633 C0009871 C0344225 C0009886 C0009881 C0009905 C0274536 C0481121 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 C1947944 C0024485 C0336660 C0412675 C0412712 C2117023 C2121336 C2123207 C2123209 C0202762 C0412674 C0412710 C0412714 C0412717 C2985394 C0442974 C2960591 C0202688 C1960255 C2960779 C0177803 C0243032 C0412692 C0412707 C0412709 C0412713 C0412716 C2058238 C1656864 C0202756 C0202826 C0412688 C0412694 C0412700 C0584863 C1691007 C1960809 C2315149 C2315895 C2315957 C2454646 C0203201 C0344104 C0412685 C0412693 C0412701 C0412702 C0436428 C0879554 C1135565 C1136216 C2106285 C0412689 C0412698 C0412699 C1634512 C1637834 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0028754 ", "concepts": "Cerebral Blood Flow, Consumption, Obesity, Obesity, D-Glucose, Glucose summary, summary glucose, study blood flow, LV blood flow, RV blood flow, obesity, brain, Indifference obesity development, Development, Development, Development, No development, obesity criteria, Eligibility Criteria Age menses Body mass index, Body mass index, low body mass index, body mass index high, Weight, Weight, Weights obesity, groups obesity, groups Criteria high blood pressure, High blood pressure, blood pressure, blood pressure, blood pressure, glucose intolerance, Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes, fasting, fastin Dysmetabolic syndrome x, Dysmetabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism, H/O: hypothyroidism, kidneys, kidneys, liver, heart disease, h disease psychiatric disorders, Psychiatric disorders, Psychiatric disorders NEC, Hx of Psychiatric disorders, Hx of Psychiatric disorders, psychiatric disorders mood, illicit drug, alcoholism pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
