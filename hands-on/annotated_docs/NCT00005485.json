{"text": "TITLE:\n      Environmental and Genetic Factors That Influence Cardiovascular Disease in African Americans\nSUMMARY:\n      This is a prospective study of the environmental and genetic factors that influence the\n      development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in African American men and women. The cohort is\n      an expansion of the Jackson, Mississippi site of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities\n      (ARIC) study and is a partnership among two minority institutions (Jackson State University\n      and Tougaloo College), one majority institution in Jackson, Mississippi (the University of\n      Mississippi Medical Center), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center on\n      Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood\n      Institute (NHLBI).\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      BACKGROUND:\n      Heart disease and stroke remain the first and third leading killers of all Americans, with a\n      disproportionate share of the burden borne by African Americans. Cardiovascular and total\n      mortality are known to be higher among African Americans than among white Americans, but\n      reasons for these differences remain unknown. In addition, well-documented declines in CVD\n      and coronary disease mortality in the past three decades have not been shared equally\n      between blacks and whites. Age-adjusted death rates were identical in both groups in 1980,\n      but by 1994 the rate among African Americans was 14% higher than in whites. The race\n      difference in magnitude of coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality is greater in women than\n      men and higher in middle age, such that CHD deaths tend to occur in blacks about 5 years\n      earlier than in whites. Excess cerebrovascular disease incidence and mortality in blacks are\n      even greater than the differences noted in CHD.\n      Cardiovascular mortality rates in Mississippi, which are approximately 25% higher than the\n      United States average, are the highest in the United States for all race-sex groups.\n      Age-adjusted CVD mortality for African American women in Mississippi was 75% higher than in\n      white women in 1994. The mortality for African American men was 47% higher than in white\n      men.\n      Prevalence of hypertension is nearly 40% greater in African Americans than in whites and its\n      sequelae are more frequent and severe. Evidence of target organ damage such as renal failure\n      and left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in black than white hypertensives at\n      comparable levels of blood pressure. Many risk factors are also more common in blacks,\n      including diabetes, high serum lipoprotein levels [Lp(a)], and obesity (in women). Other\n      risk factors, such as elevated total cholesterol, reduced high-density lipoprotein\n      (HDL)-cholesterol, and heavy cigarette smoking, are more common in whites.\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n      The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) initial examination, which began in the fall of 2000, included\n      men and women ages 35 to 84, and took 3 years to complete. The coordinating center, located\n      at Jackson State University, collects and analyzes data. The undergraduate training center\n      at Tougaloo College offers coursework to students in public health and epidemiology, and\n      provides practical experience in health research to prepare them for potential careers in\n      these fields. The exam center at the University of Mississippi is responsible for recruiting\n      participants and conducting examinations. JHS is uniquely positioned to answer key questions\n      regarding the excess burden of CVD among African Americans and to address the critical\n      shortage of minority investigators trained in epidemiology and prevention. These questions\n      will be answered by incorporating state-of-the-art physiologic and epidemiologic methods in\n      a stable population-based minority cohort, providing research experience, and building\n      research capabilities at minority institutions. The Second Exam began in September 2005.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  African American\n", "cuis": "C0007222 C0119053 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C1948182 C0007222 C0455539 C0348668 C1290379 C0455404 C0558373 C0849932 C0264656 C0042373 C0243107 C0678723 C0020119 C3272564 C3151684 C2097317 C0004153 C0004155 C0017327 C0455407 C0029899 C1611706 C0150988 C0029696 C0333494 C0947630 C1951419 C1546848 C1546848 C0199168 C1561579 C3810851 C1328956 C2718080 C1171307 C0018787 C0153500 C0153957 C1281570 C0229664 C0851353 C0024109 C1278908 C1328956 C2718080 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0018799 C0038454 C3887460 C0007220 C3845898 C1301725 C1609436 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C1556133 C3541433 C0085632 C0010068 C1956346 C1552839 C0011065 C1306577 C1114365 C0729829 C0010054 C0010068 C1956346 C1277690 C0034072 C0085632 C3842396 C1552826 C0011065 C1306577 C3842265 C0007820 C0585890 C0393949 C0810006 C0553766 C0393950 C0085632 C3887460 C0007220 C0729829 C1552839 C0009253 C1114365 C2097317 C2097317 C0020538 C1963138 C1696708 C2748577 C0947663 C0035078 C0001623 C1963154 C3267129 C3810103 C1167727 C0243088 C0543419 C0010957 C0178784 C1306232 C0149721 C0232306 C3484363 C2103992 C0340279 C0745681 C0344398 C0162770 C0281788 C3476091 C3245511 C0857121 C0003364 C0005823 C0005824 C1272641 C0020649 C0725357 C2230142 C0020538 C2926615 C0180208 C0428889 C0428886 C0488053 C0497247 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C3245511 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0028754 C0229671 C1546725 C1546836 C1546840 C1547233 C1547241 C1547267 C1547272 C1547281 C1547304 C1547309 C1547994 C1549063 C1549110 C1556055 C1561608 C1868670 C2598149 C1955473 C0523753 C0523476 C0582826 C0455624 C1553898 C4036105 C0455939 C3808076 C0020443 C4029322 C3245511 C0459847 C0031809 C0582103 C0018787 C0153500 C0153957 C1281570 C0947630 C0085639 C0427184 C1815293 C3245479 C0442694 C1554161 C1951419 C0179038 C2239238 C3244304 C0699943 C1553687 C0699910 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0043440 C1555587 C2222792 C1273518 C1553496 C0031809 C0582103 C0556030 C1547298 C1547308 C1551396 C0376649 C0699910 C0199176 C0080194 C0025663 C0025664 C0699910 C0031843 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0699530 C0582103 C1546848 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C2097317 ", "concepts": "Cardiovascular Disease, Geneticin summary, summary study, genetics CVD -
