{"text": "TITLE:\n      Ibuprofen or Morphine in Treating Pain in Patients Undergoing Pleurodesis for Malignant Pleural Effusion\nSUMMARY:\n      RATIONALE: Morphine and ibuprofen help lessen pain caused by pleurodesis. It is not yet\n      known whether one drug is more effective than the other in lessening pleurodesis-related\n      pain or whether the size of the chest drain tube affects pain.\n      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying ibuprofen to see how well it works\n      compared with morphine in treating pain in patients undergoing pleurodesis for malignant\n      pleural effusion.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      OBJECTIVES:\n      Primary\n        -  To evaluate the efficacy of a non-steroidal based regimen comprising ibuprofen in\n           decreasing post-pleurodesis pain as compared to an opiate-based regimen comprising\n           morphine sulfate in patients with malignant pleural effusion.\n        -  To evaluate whether chest drain size influences the amount of post-pleurodesis pain.\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histological\n      tissue type (mesothelioma vs non-mesothelioma) and thoracoscopic procedure. Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a large bore chest drain (24F)\n           on day 0 and receive oral ibuprofen 3 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is removed\n           on day 3.\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a small bore chest drain (12F)\n           on day 0 and receive oral ibuprofen 3 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is removed\n           on day 3.\n        -  Arm III: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a large bore chest drain (24F)\n           on day 0 and receive oral morphine sulfate 4 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is\n           removed on day 3.\n        -  Arm IV: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a small bore chest drain (12F)\n           on day 0 and receive oral morphine sulfate 4 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is\n           removed on day 3.\n      All patients will receive regular background analgesia comprising paracetamol 4 times daily\n      on days 0-3. Patients not adequately treated with these regimens may also receive rescue\n      analgesia comprising morphine sulfate IV on days 0-3.\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months, and\n      periodically thereafter.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:\n          -  Diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis confirmed by 1 of the\n             following:\n               -  Histologically proven pleural malignancy\n               -  Typical features of pleural malignancy seen on direct vision during thoracoscopy\n               -  Pleural effusion in the context of histologically proven cancer elsewhere\n          -  No primary lymphoma or small cell lung carcinoma\n          -  All patients undergoing thoracoscopy for suspected malignant pleural effusion are\n             eligible\n        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:\n          -  Life expectancy > 1 month\n          -  Not pregnant or nursing\n          -  No history of GI bleeding or untreated peptic ulceration\n          -  No known sensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opiates, or\n             paracetamol\n          -  No hypercapnic respiratory failure\n          -  No known intravenous drug abuse\n          -  No severe renal or liver disease\n          -  No known bleeding diathesis\n          -  Able to give informed consent\n        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:\n          -  More than 2 weeks since prior and no concurrent corticosteroid therapy\n          -  No concurrent warfarin therapy\n          -  No other concurrent analgesics\n               -  Analgesics used as a breakthrough regimen are allowed from trial entry to tube\n                  withdrawal at day 3 post-pleurodesis (i.e., regular paracetamol, assigned study\n                  analgesia, and breakthrough medication only, including opiate slow release\n                  patches)\n          -  No concurrent enrollment on another clinical study\n               -  Patients may participate in other trials immediately after completion of current\n                  trial, excluding those involving further pleural procedures or analgesia trials\n                  in which patients must wait at least 3 months after completion of current trial\n", "cuis": "C0080032 C0189557 C0020740 C2608256
