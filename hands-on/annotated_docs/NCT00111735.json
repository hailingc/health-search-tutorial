{"text": "TITLE:\n      Thyroxine Titration Study\nSUMMARY:\n      The aim of the study is to examine the effects of fine titration of thyroxine dosage on\n      symptoms of hypothyroidism, wellbeing and quality of life. The hypothesis is that symptoms\n      of hypothyroidism, wellbeing and quality of life will be improved in thyroxine-treated\n      subjects when serum thyrotropin (TSH) is suppressed and/or in the lower reference range,\n      compared to when TSH is in the upper reference range.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Primary hypothyroidism is a common disorder, affecting 2% of the Australian population. The\n      standard treatment is with thyroxine (T4), and conventionally, a serum thyrotropin (TSH)\n      concentration within the laboratory range is taken as indicating adequacy of thyroxine\n      dosage.\n      Some patients with hypothyroidism complain of persistently impaired well-being, despite\n      taking thyroxine in a dose which normalises serum TSH concentrations. It is not clear\n      whether this is because of comorbidity or because standard thyroxine replacement is in some\n      way inadequate for some individuals.\n      The reference range for serum TSH is wide (currently 0.34-4.8 mU/L at PathCentre). The\n      distribution of serum TSH concentrations in the population is skewed, with the mean and\n      median in the lower reference range at approximately 1.0 mU/L. This has led some to argue\n      that a serum TSH in the lower reference range should be the usual therapeutic target.\n      Anecdotal evidence suggests that some thyroxine-treated patients do feel better if the\n      thyroxine dose is adjusted so that serum TSH is in the lower reference range rather than the\n      upper reference range. The National Academy for Clinical Biochemistry of the United States\n      now recommends, that for thyroxine-treated patients, that serum TSH should be less than 2.0\n      mU/L. There is, however, no evidence from properly conducted studies that aiming for a serum\n      TSH concentration in the lower reference range improves symptoms of hypothyroidism or\n      general wellbeing, and this proposal has not been generally adopted.\n      Only one study examining the effects of fine titration of thyroxine dosage on wellbeing has\n      been published. In this study, patients had significantly improved wellbeing if they took a\n      dose of thyroxine which was 50 \u03bcg greater than their biochemically optimal dose as\n      determined by a thyrotropin-releasing hormone test. In most cases, serum TSH was suppressed\n      to below 0.2 mU/L (the limit of sensitivity of the assay) on the thyroxine doses which\n      improved wellbeing. This study was open-label and non-randomised, and the results therefore\n      may have been affected by bias.\n      A well-designed, double blind study of the effects of fine titration of thyroxine dosage on\n      symptoms of hypothyroidism, wellbeing and quality of life is required to determine if a\n      serum TSH in the lower reference range, rather than simply TSH within the reference range,\n      should indeed be the usual therapeutic target for thyroxine therapy in primary\n      hypothyroidism. It is also desirable to confirm the findings of Carr et al., that patients\n      have improved wellbeing if TSH is suppressed to below normal levels.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion
