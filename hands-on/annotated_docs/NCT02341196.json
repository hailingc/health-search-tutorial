{"text": "TITLE:\n      Randomized Clinical Trial of Polyester vs. Polyurethane Patch for Carotid Endarterectomy\nSUMMARY:\n      This study examines the risk of thrombogenicity of the carotid patches in polyurethane\n      compared to carotid patches in polyester including death, any stroke, carotid thrombosis at\n      30 days and long-term results including stroke and recurrent carotid stenosis at 10 years.\n      This study was run at the University of Roma, La Sapienza and at the University of Poitiers,\n      randomisation was done in both enters after approval by the Ethical committee of the\n      University of Roma (Record uploaded)\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This study examines the risk of thrombogenicity of the carotid patches in polyurethane\n      compared to carotid patches in polyester including death, any stroke, carotid thrombosis at\n      30 days and long-term results including stroke and recurrent carotid stenosis at 10 years.\n      598 patients were considered for randomisation between January 1995 and January 2004. The\n      following patients were excluded for randomisation (Redo carotid surgery: N=34, radiation\n      induced carotid stenosis:N=45, indication for carotid bypass: N=65, Refusal of\n      randomisation: N=4).\n      In total, 450 patients were randomized in two groups, 225 received a polyester patch and 225\n      received a polyurethane patch.\n      All patients were operated under general anaesthesia and all received an intraoperative\n      angiography. A shunt was selectively used in patients with a recent stroke (<15 days) or\n      with a contralateral carotid occlusion\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Carotid stenosis > 60% NASCET criteria\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Redo carotid surgery\n          -  Radiation induced carotid stenosis\n          -  Extensive carotid lesion > 5 cm in length with involvement of the common carotid\n             artery best treated by a carotid bypass\n", "cuis": "C0206034 C0014099 C0332461 C0991556 C0994894 C1305400 C1552616 C1706244 C0741968 C0947630 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0007274 C0741968 C0038454 C0011065 C1306577 C0007282 C0038454 C3842337 C0947630 C0445583 C0600140 C1171947 C2346845 C0034869 C0445583 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0741968 C0947630 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0007274 C0741968 C0038454 C0011065 C1306577 C0007282 C0038454 C3842337 C0741984 C1552867 C1522449 C1524020 C1963223 C0007282 C0741968 C0741847 C1552839 C0994894 C1305400 C0994894 C1305400 C0002915 C1719976 C0017302 C1135564 C0002978 C1536105 C1690968 C0038454 C0265101 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0007282 C0243161 C0243161 C0741984 C0007282 C1522449 C1524020 C1963223 C0809849 C0741968 C0221198 C0772294 C3245511 C0741968 C0003842 C0741847 C0332155 ", "concepts": "Randomized Clinical Trial, Carotid Endarterectomy, Patch, Patch, Patch, Patch summary, summary carotid, study, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined carotid thrombosis, carotid, stroke, deaths, death carotid stenosis, stroke, 0 days study, Roma, run committed, Approval Record, Roma description, prescription, prescription carotid, study, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined carotid thrombosis, carotid, stroke, deaths, death carotid stenosis, stroke, 0 days carotid surgery, exclude, Radiation, Radiation, Radiation carotid stenosis, carotid, bypass groups, patchs, patchs patchs, patchs general anaesthesia, Under general anaesthesia, general anaesthetic, intraoperative MRI angiography, CT angiography, US angiography, stroke carotid occlusion criteria, Eligibility Criteria Carotid stenosis, criteria Criteria carotid surgery carotid stenosis, Radiation, Radiation, Radiation, Radiation Rx carotid, lesion, Alesion, common carotid, artery, bypass, untreated "}
