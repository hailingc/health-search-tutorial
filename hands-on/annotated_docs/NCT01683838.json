{"text": "TITLE:\n      Safety and Efficacy of Oral Fampridine-Sustained Release (SR) for the Treatment of Spasticity Resulting From Spinal Cord Injury\nSUMMARY:\n      Normally, nerve fibers carry electrical impulses through the spinal cord, providing\n      communication between the brain and the arms and legs. In people with spinal cord injury,\n      some fibers may be destroyed at the site of injury, while others remain connected but do not\n      work correctly to carry electrical impulses. As a result, subjects with an incomplete spinal\n      cord injury may have spasticity which is muscle spasms or muscle stiffness that makes\n      movement difficult. Fampridine-SR is an experimental drug that increases the ability of the\n      nerve to conduct electrical impulses. This study will examine the effects of Fampridine-SR\n      on moderate to severe lower-limb spasticity, as well as the effects on bodily functions such\n      as bladder control, bowel function and sexual function. The study will also examine the\n      possible risks of taking Fampridine-SR.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Incomplete traumatic Spinal Cord Injury (at least 18 months prior and stable for 6\n             months)\n          -  Moderate to severe lower-limb spasticity\n          -  Able to give informed consent and willing to comply with protocol\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Pregnancy\n          -  History of seizures\n          -  Existing or history of frequent Urinary Tract Infections\n          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse\n          -  Allergy to pyridine-containing substances\n          -  Received a botox injection 4 months prior to study\n          -  Received an investigational drug within 30 days\n          -  Previously treated with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)\n          -  Not on stable medication dosing in 3 weeks prior to study\n          -  Abnormal ECG or laboratory value at screening\n", "cuis": "C0037929 C0000477 C1449659 C0026838 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0030685 C1963578 C2732140 C0750197 C1552616 C1706244 C0037925 C0153646 C0154034 C0496938 C1278836 C0699809 C0699530 C0225326 C0037929 C0878589 C0852693 C0859273 C0015385 C0006104 C3263723 C0225326 C0699809 C0606665 C0221170 C4024610 C4024962 C0037763 C0700153 C0026838 C3263723 C0013230 C0304229 C1449659 C0000477 C1299586 C0026649 C1449659 C0000477 C0947630 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C0026838 C0015385 C0031843 C1306232 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C0542565 C0876938 C2584331 C0042024 C0278092 C0278095 C0011135 C0947630 C0000589 C0025638 C0332128 C1449659 C0000477 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0037929 C1561542 C1561542 C0026838 C1547226 C4049705 C4049706 C0015385 C1306232 C0442711 C1507394 C1522729 C2348563 C3715209 C0600109 C0558080 C1299581 C0009797 C0243161 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0036572 C0262926 C2004062 C0042029 C0262926 C2004062 C0085762 C0262926 C2004062 C0013227 C1254351 C0034251 C0175774 C0914738 C0020517 C0718579 C1527304 C3539909 C0075414 C0612235 C0021485 C1533685 C0444600 C0021493 C0700702 C0947630 C3843399 C0013230 C3245491 C3842337 C0000477 C0051326 C0332155 C0013227 C2081612 C2094204 C0033045 C1971835 C0802604 C2598133 C0947630 C0522055 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 ", "concepts": "Spinal Cord Injury, Fampridine, Fampridine-SR, Spasticity, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Release, Release, Sustain, Sustained VT summary, summary spinal cords, Spinal cord, Spinal cord, Spinal cord, Spinal cord, carry, providine, fiber spinal cord injury, acute spinal cord injury, Spinal cord injury NEC, Spinal cord injury NOS, arms and legs, brain injury, fiber carry, pinal muscle stiffness, Leg muscle stiffness, Axial muscle stiffness, muscle spasm, Muscle spasm, spasticity, injury experimental drug, experimental drug, Fampridine-SR, Fampridine, difficulty, Movement Fampridine-SR, Fampridine, study, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined spasticity, limb, function, severed, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate Bladder control, bladder control, Bladder control, bladder control loss, sexual function, Male sexual function, bowel function, study, Mexamine, Hexamine, examined Fampridine-SR, Fampridine criteria, Eligibility Criteria Spinal Cord Injury, month month spasticity, Moderate, Moderate, Moderate, limb, severed Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, Protocol, willing, Unwilling, Able, informed consent form Criteria pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
