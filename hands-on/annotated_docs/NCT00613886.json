 Brain CT or MRI findings of enlarged ventricles compared to established standards\n             (minimum Evans ratio of 0.30 as measured by reviewing films)\n          -  Mental impairment must be mild to moderate, emerging with or after the walking\n             difficulties\n          -  Age > or = 18 years old\n          -  MMSE (Mini-mental status exam): < or = 10\n          -  Urinary incontinence\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  No or only minimal walking difficulties combined with severe dementia\n          -
