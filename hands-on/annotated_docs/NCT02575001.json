{"text": "TITLE:\n      The Influence of Psychobiological Adversity to Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes\nSUMMARY:\n      The aims of this study are two fold: To show whether there is an increased environmental or\n      genetic susceptibility to stress in patients with T1D and whether it influences diabetes\n      management. And to develop a strategy for the assessment and treatment of patients with T1D\n      and an increased risk for development of psychopathology under stress.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Lately, a marked increase in the incidence and earlier age of onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D)\n      has been noted. These observations could also be connected to an increased prevalence of\n      stressful experiences and a lowered stress tolerance in some children.\n      The way a person responds to stress is determined by the interplay of genetic and\n      environmental factors. Environmental experiences at specific times of development have been\n      shown to shape individual's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) stress response.\n      It is known, that early development of central nervous system is critically dependent on\n      child's interaction with the environment (experience dependent maturation), especially to\n      the attachment to caregivers (most often the mother). Appropriate caregiving is connected to\n      lower basal cortisol levels in children and a more stable HPA axis response after the\n      exposure to stress. Any circumstances that disturbed the formation of the attachment to the\n      primary caregiver (e.g. complications at delivery, psychosocial stressors affecting the\n      mother or mother's postpartum depression) resulted in higher HPA axis responsiveness to\n      stress in the affected children.\n      Changes in individual genes have also been shown to influence a person's susceptibility to\n      stress and risk for the development of stress-induced psychopathology.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Informed consent signed by a parent/legal guardian and informed assent signed by the\n             study participant prior study entry\n          -  Diagnosed with Type 1 DM/Hashimoto thyroiditis prior to signature of Patient Informed\n             Consent (PIC) (for the T1D group).\n          -  Age between 8-15 years old (inclusive) at signature of PIC\n          -  Treated by the investigator's centre prior signature of PIC (For the T1D and HT\n             group).\n          -  Willing to undergo all study procedures\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Any documented concomitant chronic disease known to affect diabetes control (e.g.\n             altered renal function, active cancer undergoing treatment, Crohn's disease,\n             ulcerative colitis, Mb Addison disease)\n          -  Any other medical, social or psychological condition that, in the investigator's\n             opinion, makes the patient unable to comply with the study protocol (e.g.\n             intellectual disability).\n", "cuis": "C0011854 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C0012655 C3838076
