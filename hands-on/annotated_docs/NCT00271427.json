{"text": "TITLE:\n      Selenium Treatment in Autoimmune Thyroiditis (AIT)\nSUMMARY:\n      Selenium suppresses autoimmune destruction of thyrocytes and decreases titers of serum TPOAb\n      in AIT patients. Older 4 clinical trials approved the efficacy of the daily dose of 200micg.\n      It's believed that Se saturates the deficient stores of GPX so GPX saves the thyrocytes\n      against to oxidative stresses. Although less than 70 micg/d is sufficient to maximize GPX\n      activity, none of the authors tested the doses less than 200 micg/d. Our hypothesis was that\n      If 100 micg/d can not suppress the TPOAb titers,it means autoimmune destruction can not be\n      blocked by saturation of deficient stores of GPX solely and the mechanism of action requires\n      more than repletion of deficient stores. It's important not only to estimate the optimal\n      dose but to understand the mechanism of action. High dose therapy may also suppress TPOAb\n      levels in Se-non-deficient AIT patients, if it is so, Se therapy may becomes the solely\n      treatment modality which can suppress the autoimmunity in more than 400 million AIT\n      patients. Because there've been no way to suppress autoimmune war and replacement of LT4 had\n      been the only treatment modality for palliation. An other independent part of the study is\n      to test the effect of Se in adolescent AIT patients.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Clinically approved AIT patients who do not use any medication other than LT4 to keep\n             TSH in the lower half of normal range.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Any kind of drug use other than LT4 or any kind of known pathology which may effect\n             GIS absorption.\n", "cuis": "C0677607 C0920350 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0373721 C0521939 C1552616 C1706244 C1261381 C0443146 C0373721 C0521939 C0229671 C1096775 C0038435 C0392366 C0228018 C0600075 C3668946 C4049938 C1261381 C0443146 C0084688 C0031327 C0028778 C0746961 C0678723 C1254042 C0523807 C3245501 C3245502 C0031327 C0162340 C0087111 C0033972 C0235146 C0084688 C0087111 C0033972 C0004364 C0004368 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0084688 C1547664 C0035139 C1555302 C0441587 C0443146 C0084688 C1299583 C0599749 C0011546 C0439857 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0947630 C1547664 C0392366 C0456984 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0240320 C0260268 C0850893 C0849168 C3272565 C1553386 C2702329 C0243161 C0677042 C0919386 C0242510 C2239127 C0476643 C3845898 C0815319 C0024523 C1963165 C3714745 ", "concepts": "Autoimmune Thyroiditis, Autoimmune Thyroiditis, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Selenium, Selenium summary, summary destruction, autoimmune, Selenium, Selenium, serum clinical trials stressed tested, teste, Activity, Activity, Activity destruction, autoimmune, suppressin mechanism of action, blocked, Desaturation, Maturation, Maturation, O2 saturation, required, required mechanism of action, understand, therapy, Cotherapy, High, suppressin therapy, Cotherapy autoimmunity, Autoimmunity, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, suppressin, Modality replacements, Replacement, placement, autoimmune, suppressin independent, independency, dependency, dependence, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, study, Modality test, test criteria, Eligibility Criteria use medication, abuse medication, cease medication, eye medication, Clinical normal, Orange Criteria pathology, pathology, Drug use, drug use, Drug use, Uknown gis, malabsorption, Malabsorption, malabsorption "}
