{"text": "TITLE:\n      Arterial Elasticity: A Substudy of Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START)\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to find out if starting anti-retroviral therapy (ART) above 500\n      cluster-of-differentiation-4 (CD4)+ cells/milliliter (mL) ('early ART group') is better at\n      reducing the stiffness of arteries than waiting to start ART until the CD4+ drops below 350\n      cells/mL ('deferred ART group'). Artery stiffness has been associated with an increased risk\n      of cardiovascular (heart) disease, and could be useful as an earlier indicator of heart\n      disease. In this study, the stiffness of arteries will be measured at study entry, months 4,\n      8, 12, and annually thereafter, using a tonometer on the participant's forearm.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Simultaneous co-enrollment in the START study\n          -  Signed informed consent\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Inability to ascertain waveform measurements that can be analyzed, i.e. atrial\n             fibrillation\n", "cuis": "C1831583 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C0003842 C1552850 C1552616 C1706244 C0087111 C0033972 C0947630 C3816747 C0699576 C1511938 C0002793 C1552839 C0427008 C0003842 C0397581 C1552850 C0013604 C3882767 C0427008 C0003842 C1552839 C1554180 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C3887460 C0007220 C0436125 C0497234 C0021212 C0012634 C0018609 C0018787 C0427008 C0003842 C0397581 C0012634 C0018609 C0947630 C1561542 C0183969 C0016536 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C3888021 C1516879 C1552850 C0947630 C1519316 C0009797 C0243161 C0018792 C0524422 C0423103 C2048307 C3838520 C0179038 C0232197 C0013778 ", "concepts": "Elasticity, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Arterial, start summary, summary therapy, Cotherapy, study, 500, retrovir differentiation, Dedifferentiation, groups stiffness, arteries, Arteries, start, dropsy, Ddrops stiffness, Artery, groups, Deferred, CK increased, LH increased, PT increased, QT increased, pH increased, GH increased, increased mg, CI increased, Na increased, K+ increased, Zn increased, T4 increased, T3 increased cardiovascular, cardiovascular drug, cardiovascular exam, Pain;cardiovascular, indicator, disease, h disease, heart stiffness, arteries, Arteries, disease, h disease, study, month tonometer, forearm criteria, Eligibility Criteria enrollment, Enrollment, start, study Signed, informed consent form Criteria atrial, atria, Eye measurements, ICD measurements, arm measurements, analyzer fibrillation, Defibrillation "}
