{"text": "TITLE:\n      Donepezil in Preventing Delirium in Hospitalized Elderly\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of a perioperative daily dose of\n      Donepezil (a cholinergic enhancer) in reducing the incidence and severity of delirium.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Delirium is confusion or a sudden change in alertness which may happen after hip repair\n      surgery. Up to 65% of elderly undergoing surgical repair of hip fracture experience\n      post-operative delirium. These individuals often stay in the hospital longer, have more\n      complications, and are more likely to die. Early studies suggest that delirium could be\n      prevented by correcting the central cholinergic deficit that is associated with delirium.\n      Donepezil is currently being used to treat memory loss in patients with Alzheimer's disease.\n      This study will recruit 30 adults aged 65 or older who are undergoing hip fracture surgery.\n      Participants will be randomized to receive either Donepezil or a matching placebo within 24\n      hours prior to surgery and for 4 days after the surgery.\n      All material to be collected will be from interviews, questionnaires, and medical chart\n      review at baseline and daily for the entire hospital stay. The Confusion Assessment Method\n      (CAM) and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) will be used to evaluate the effect of\n      Donepezil on delirium incidence and severity. Other assessments include cognitive deficit,\n      length of hospitalization, discharge site, adverse effects, and psychotropic medications.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Community-dwelling individuals aged 65 or older\n          -  Admitted to Methodist Hospital for surgical repair of hip fracture\n          -  No evidence of delirium at admission to hospital\n          -  MMSE total score below 24 points after adjustment for education and age\n          -  Consent to participate in the study\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Severely demented as defined by MMSE score below 10\n          -  Metastatic cancer or other comorbid illnesses likely to reduce life expectancy to\n             under 6 months\n          -  Multiple trauma or pathological fractures\n          -  Aphasic, legally blind, or deaf\n          -  Use of Donepezil or other cholinesterase inhibitors within one month prior to surgery\n          -  Allergy to Donepezil\n", "cuis": "C0527316 C0011206 C0701159 C1552616 C1706244 C0947630 C0180799 C0527316 C0011206 C0242893 C1705733 C2983285 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0186193 C0192038 C0009676 C0683369 C1963086 C1443086 C0011206 C0374711 C0567345 C0019557 C0332757 C0149531 C0518449 C2031471 C3669928 C0237607 C0596545 C3845885 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0011206 C0030201 C2112579 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0011206 C0947630 C0011206 C0242893 C0002395 C1271045 C0338450 C0477364 C1521724 C0002622 C0751295 C0527316 C0019557 C0332757 C0149531 C0518449 C2031471 C3669928 C3844361 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0947630 C0527316 C0032042 C0231617 C0441615 C0598016 C2371283 C2584298 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0034394 C1706422 C3836256 C3836250 C3836251 C3836252 C3836254 C3836255 C0007963 C0684240 C0935630 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1261322 C2826217 C0009676 C0683369 C1963086 C2712099 C0282443 C0025663 C2827714 C2828387 C0728774 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C1261322 C2826217 C0011206 C0175659 C0222045 C0349674 C0684254 C0009241 C0338656 C1261322 C0031809 C0220825 C0870300 C0527316 C0011206 C1546725 C1546836 C1546840 C1547233 C1547241 C1547267 C1547272 C1547281 C1547304 C1547309 C1547994 C1549063 C1549110 C1556055 C1561608 C1868670 C2598149 C1955473 C2983285 C0019993 C3840878 C3841837 C3841838 C0879626 C0559546 C0853204 C0013227 C2094204 C0802604 C2598133 C2081612 C0033045 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C0033978 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C3844361 C3694424 C0038999 C0374711 C0567345 C0019557 C0332757 C0149531 C0518449 C2031471 C3669928 C0809949 C0184666 C0184666 C3650404 C2215406 C2215408 C0583225 C0011206 C0424927 C0013658 C2945673 C0281902 C3668976 C0947630 C0243161 C0860630 C0011343 C2939419 C2939420 C0027627 C0346957 C0278484 C0221423 C1858274 C1561542 C0016663 C0026771 C0456909 C0008425 C0001046 C0877006 C0596537 C0527316 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C1561542 C1947944 C0527316 C0020517 C0718579 C1527304 C3539909 ", "concepts": "Donepezil, Delirium, hospitalized summary, summary study, explorer Donepezil, delirium, cholinergics, Enhancer, Severity description, prescription, prescription hip repair, Lip repair, confusion, Confusion, Confusion, alertness, Delirium surgical repair, Microsurgical repair, hip fractures, chip fractures, Hip fracture, Hip fractures, hip fracture old, P1 chip fracture, experience, experience, Inexperience, surgery, surgery, surgery: delirium, pain post-operative, post-operative care Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, delirium, studies delirium, cholinergics Alzheimer's disease, NOS, FH: Alzheimer's disease, Focal Alzheimer's disease, Other Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Memory loss, Memory loss, Donepezil hip fractures, chip fractures, Hip fracture, Hip fractures, hip fracture old, P1 chip fracture, 65 or older, surgery, surgery, surgery:, study Donepezil, placebo, catching, patching, hatching, Watching, Catching surgery, surgery, surgery: questionnaires, Questionnaires, questionnaires ad8, questionnaires moca, questionnaires koos, questionnaires kccq, questionnaires hoos, questionnaires bomc, chart, chart, interview assessment, Assessment, Assessment, assessment, No Assessment, confusion, Confusion, Confusion, No Confusion, review, Methods, Method, Method, Vaseline assessment, Evaluate, Assessment, assessment, No Assessment, Delirium, Scales, Scales, Scale, Scaler cognitive deficits, Cognitive deficits, assessment, Assessment, Assessment, Assessment, Donepezil, delirium, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Other, Others, Severity hospitalization, Hospitalization 1, Hospitalization 3, Hospitalization 2, adverse effects, adverse effect, No adverse effect, medications, medications:, Medications, Medications, medication:, Premedications, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Psychotropic criteria, Eligibility Criteria 65 or older, Indwelling, Swelling surgical repair, Microsurgical repair, hip fractures, chip fractures, Hip fracture, Hip fractures, hip fracture old, P1 chip fracture, Admitted, admitted admission to hospital, admission to hospital unit, admission to hospital to bed, admission to hospital floor, Admission to GP hospital, delirium Education, Education, adjustments, maladjustment, Total score study Criteria Demented, cemented Metastatic cancer, metastatic cancer, metastatic cancer, metastatic cancer, Metastatic colon cancer, illnesses, Reduced life expectancy month pathological fractures, Multiple trauma blind Cholinesterase Inhibitors, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, Cholinesterase inhibition, esterase inhibitors, Donepezil, surgery, surgery, surgery:, month, Use Donepezil, Allergy., Allergy, Allergy, Allergy "}
