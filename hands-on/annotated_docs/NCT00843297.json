{"text": "TITLE:\n      COOL-Trial: Outcome With Invasive and Non-invasive Cooling After Cardiac Arrest\nSUMMARY:\n      Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remains one of the major leading causes of death. Cognitive\n      deficits are common in survivors of SCA. Postresuscitative mild induced hypothermia (MIH)\n      lowers mortality and reduces neurologic damage after cardiac arrest. The investigators\n      evaluated the efficacy and side effects of therapeutic hypothermia in an unselected group of\n      patients after SCA.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Consecutive patients with restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after resuscitation\n      due to out-of-hospital SCA, admitted to our intensive care unit, underwent MIH. Hypothermia\n      was induced by infusion of cold saline and whole-body-cooling methods (electronic\n      randomization: invasive Coolgard or non-invasive ArcticSun). The core body temperature was\n      operated at 32 to 34 \u00b0C over a period of 24 hours followed by active rewarming. Neurological\n      status was evaluated at hospital discharge and 6 months after discharge using the Pittsburgh\n      Cerebral Performance Category (CPC). Blood samples of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were\n      collected during 72 hours.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  ROSC after SCA due to VF/VT or PEA/Asystolia\n          -  GCS 3\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Non-cardiac SCA\n          -  Pregnancy\n          -  Unstable Circulation instead of High-dose Inotropics\n          -  Life-expectancy reducing concomitant illness\n", "cuis": "C0018790 C1334278 C1966209 C1455871 C1552616 C1706244 C0007465 C0018790 C1410098 C3841758 C0020674 C1301797 C3245511 C0033223 C0018790 C1410098 C3841758 C0010957 C3540799 C0020672 C0413252 C0020673 C1963170 C0879626 C0087111 C0723712 C0723719 C1547427 C0220825 C1552839 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0035273 C2366754 C2587207 C3854420 C0449982 C0005775 C1516559 C0085559 C0020672 C0020673 C0413252 C1963170 C0184666 C0809949 C0033223 C0574032 C0854643 C0025663 C0025664 C0009443 C0234192 C0152338 C0723199 C0456240 C1334278 C2065012 C2707261 C0025344 C0586003 C0814903 C0488552 C0489550 C0551606 C0488553 C1657769 C0374572 C0374573 C1545499 C0012621 C0030685 C0600083 C1546601 C2926602 C0220825 C1561542 C0228174 C0006104 C0683312 C1552740 C0229664 C0851353 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0018790 C3257529 C0243161 C0018787 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C0005775 C1516559 C0443343 C0235146 C0221423 C0424228 ", "concepts": "Cardiac Arrest, Invasive, Triall, Non-invasive PPV summary, summary causes of death, cardiac arrest, NB cardiac arrest, Yes, cardiac arrest Induced hypothermia, Induced hypothermia, common, mih cardiac arrest, NB cardiac arrest, Yes, cardiac arrest, damage, flowers hypothermic, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, Hypothermia, side effect, Therapeutics, Therapeutic, therapeutic m, Therapeutic, Evaluated, groups description, prescription, prescription resuscitation, Nb resuscitation, For resuscitation, Autoresuscitation, restoration, circulations, Circulation intensive care, hypothermia, Hypothermia, hypothermia, Hypothermia, admitted, Admitted, mih infusion, Reinfusion, methods, methods, cold, cold, body, salinex core body temperature, Invasive active rewarming, Neurological, period hospital discharge, hospital discharge data, Hospital discharge Dx, Hospital discharge Dx, Hospital discharge Dx, Hospital discharge Hx, Admin;hospital discharge, Hospital discharge day, Hospital discharge day, Hospital discharge DRG, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Discharge, Evaluated, month Cerebral, cerebral, Category, specific, Blood, Blood criteria, Eligibility Criteria Asystolia, pea Criteria cardiac pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
