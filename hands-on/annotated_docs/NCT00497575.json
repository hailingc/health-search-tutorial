The purpose of this study was to explore the diagnostic criteria\n      for subclinical hypothyroidism and the initial dosage of L-thyroxine through long-term\n      follow up for infants with hyperthyrotropinemia\uff0cand evaluate the curative effect.All\n      live-born neonates in province took part in the screening program from October, 1999 to\n      September ,2006. Laboratory tests are performed as a time resolved fluoro-immunoassay\n      (TRFIA). TSH is measured with a cut-off > 9 mU/L. The diagnostic standard for subclinical\n      hypothyroidism was: TSH \u2265 20 mU/L, T3 and T4 normal or low-normal ,or TSH > 5.6 mU/L and <\n      20 mU/L on initial determination and on follow-up or TSH levels increase on follow-up and/or\n      gradually declining T4 levels.L-Thyroxine was administered for substitution therapy. After 2\n      years therapy\uff0callround evaluation was performed. Compare the correlation to effects with\n      different level of TSH\u3001starting time of therapy and environment. Compare the effects between\n      subclinical\u3001temporary and permanent hypothyroidism.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  The diagnostic standard for manifest hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism\n             was defined as follows:\n               -  Hypothyroidism - TSH > 40 mU/L and T3 and T4 below the reference range or TSH >\n                  40 mU/L, T3 normal and T4 below the reference range [2]\n               -  Subclinical hypothyroidism - TSH \u2265 20 mU/L, T3 and T4 normal or low-normal or\n                  TSH > 5.6 mU/L and < 20 mU/L on initial determination and on follow-up or TSH\n                  levels increase on follow-up and/or gradually declining T4 levels.\n", "cuis": "C0020676 C0577643 C0011900 C0945731 C1719822 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1552616 C1706244 C0271790 C1998045 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0679228 C0700287 C1549114 C0684224 C0947630 C0180799 C0271790 C1998045 C0079691 C0040165 C0271790 C1998045 C0220825 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0271790 C1998045 C0439775 C0429067 C0429107 C0520886 C0679228 C0700287 C1549114 C0684224 C0947630 C0180799 C0271790 C1998045 C0079691 C0040165 C0220825 C0199230 C0220908 C1409616 C1698960 C1710031 C0020980 C0022885 C1571737 C2598148 C3714811 C1514893 C0392366 C3850116 C0235665 C0000925 C0228549 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0011900 C0358514 C0430022 C1547424 C0020676 C0455486 C0853283 C1553386 C1550472 C1148554 C0036871 C0369183 C0427460 C0429519 C0202230 C0040165 C1881373 C0011824 C2936885 C0202231 C1281902 C0087111 C0033972 C0505385 C0446414 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0087111 C0033972 C0020676 C0455486 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0271790 C1998045 C0020676 C0455486 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C0011900 C0358514 C0430022 C1547424 C0020676 C0577643 C1514811 C1561577 C2702329 C0853627 C1514811 C1561577 C2702329 C0271790 C1998045 C0853283 C1553386 C1550472 C1148554 C0036871 C0369183 C0427460 C0429519 C0202231 C0505385 C0446414 ", "concepts": "Hypothyroidism, NOS, FH: Hypothyroidism, {Diagnosis}, Diagnosis, Follow, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient summary, summary subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation diagnostic criteria, Reported, Unreported, Reported, study, explorer subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, L-thyroxine, thyroxine subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, Evaluate description, prescription, prescription subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, elevation, PR elevation, TU elevation, ST elevation diagnostic criteria, Reported, Unreported, Reported, study, explorer subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, L-thyroxine, thyroxine Evaluate screening, Screening, screening, screening, Screening immunoassay, Laboratory, Laboratory, Laboratory, resolved, Resolved, tests, Etests, fluor cut, cut, standards, Standard, Standard, Diagnostic, Diagnostic, Diagnostic, Diagnostic hypothyroidism, H/O: hypothyroidism, T4 normal, normal, low determination, Sex determination, MCH determination, RDW determination, IOL determination, TSH level Thyroxine, L-Thyroxine, D-Thyroxine, l-Thyroxine, T4 level, Thyroxine, therapy, Cotherapy, T4 level, c4 levels Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation therapy, Cotherapy hypothyroidism, H/O: hypothyroidism criteria, Eligibility Criteria subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, H/O: hypothyroidism, standards, Standard, Standard, Diagnostic, Diagnostic, Diagnostic, Diagnostic Hypothyroidism, NOS, FH: Hypothyroidism, reference, Reference, Orange T3 normal, reference, Reference, Orange Subclinical hypothyroidism, Subclinical hyperthyroidism, T4 normal, normal, low determination, Sex determination, MCH determination, RDW determination, IOL determination T4 level, T4 level, c4 levels "}
