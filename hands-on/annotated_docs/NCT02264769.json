{"text": "TITLE:\n      Carbetocin at Elective Cesarean Delivery Part 4\nSUMMARY:\n      PostPartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal death worldwide. Oxytocin is the\n      most commonly used uterotonic drug to prevent and treat PPH in North America. However\n      oxytocin has a very short duration of action, requiring a continuous infusion to achieve\n      sustained uterotonic activity. Moreover large doses are associated with adverse effects like\n      hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dysrhythmias and ST changes. The Society of Obstetricians and\n      Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) has recommended a single dose of 100 mcg of carbetocin at\n      elective cesarean delivery to promote uterine contraction. In three studies recently\n      performed at Mount Sinai Hospital, the investigators have found no difference in uterine\n      contractility between the doses of 20- 120 mcg carbetocin and that the ED90 is 14.8 mcg.\n      Thus a larger trial comparing the minimum effective dose determined in the previous three\n      trials with the standard 100 mcg dose is necessary to confirm these findings.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The current oxytocin regimen requires the administration of a continuous infusion to achieve\n      sustained uterotonic activity, which can be associated with a number of side effects and\n      unpredictable efficacy. Carbetocin in a single 100 mcg dose has apparently greater efficacy,\n      with a similar side effect profile to that of oxytocin. In addition, some studies have also\n      shown that there is less blood loss and less requirement for additional uterotonic drugs\n      when carbetocin is administered. Studies conducted by the investigators group at Mount Sinai\n      have shown similar efficacy between the doses ranging from 20 to 100 mcg of carbetocin. In\n      the investigators study, the investigators are going to compare those two doses of\n      carbetocin to determine that 20 mcg is not inferior to 100 mcg to produce adequate uterine\n      tone in elective cesarean delivery. This study will be a randomized, double - blind, non\n      inferiority study.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia.\n          -  Written informed consent to participate in this study.\n          -  Term pregnancy\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Refusal to give written informed consent.\n          -  Allergy or hypersensitivity to carbetocin or oxytocin.\n          -  Conditions that predispose to uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage, such as\n             placenta previa, multiple gestation, preeclampsia, eclampsia, macrosomia,\n             polyhydramnios, uterine fibroids, previous history of uterine atony and postpartum\n             bleeding, or bleeding diathesis.\n          -  Hepatic, renal, and vascular disease.\n", "cuis": "C0473296 C0054670 C1552616 C1706244 C0019080 C0017181 C1861265 C1858460 C0721591 C0030095 C0523809 C1704206 C3536883 C0011065 C1306577 C0013227 C1254351 C0425358 C0444889 C0030095 C0030094 C0523809 C1704206 C1552007 C0332534 C0720099 C2926735 C0879626 C0559546 C0853204 C0600075 C3668946 C4049938 C0020649 C3163620 C0163170 C0042963 C1963281 C0027497 C0003811 C0232326 C0054670 C0087136 C0723338 C0473296 C1140999 C0567116 C0042149 C0947630 C0042149 C0085632 C3842396 C0054670 C0018792 C0038137 C2828392 C3272550 C2926606 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0444889 C1533734 C0376495 C0199808 C0199810 C0725057 C1536282 C0001563 C0036589 C0150270 C3469597 C0030095 C0030094 C0523809 C1704206 C0040808 C2945654 C3245501 C3245502 C0879626 C0600075 C3668946 C4049938 C0054670 C0087136 C0723338 C0879626 C0030095 C0030094 C0523809 C1704206 C0947630 C0019080 C0553700 C0013227 C0054670 C1552839 C0054670 C0947630 C0054670 C0042149 C0473296 C0947630 C0456909 C0947630 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0473296 C0002928 C0179053 C0947630 C0009797 C0232991 C0243161 C0009797 C0020517 C0520946 C0441750 C0013182 C0016470 C0037296 C0079840 C0585186 C4062895 C0011432 C0085636 C0151206 C0301925 C0577628 C0949570 C1405033 C0054670 C0030095 C0030094 C0523809 C1704206 C0718579 C1527304 C3539909 C0032797 C0475173 C0269899 C0473508 C0042135 C3864998 C0009647 C0032989 C0477823 C0032046 C0032914 C0013537 C0158915 C1848395 C0042133 C0020224 C0042135 C0262926 C2004062 C0005779 C1458140 C0019080 C0042373 C0747531 C0026848 C2609253 C0015397 C0007222 C0268790 C0205054 C0022646 ", "concepts": "Elective Cesarean Delivery, Carbetocin summary, summary hemorrhage, GI hemorrhage, No hemorrhage, maternal, materna, oxytocin, Oxytocin, Oxytocin, Oxytocic, deaths, death drug, drug, North American continuous infusion, oxytocin, oxytocic, Oxytocin, Oxytocin, action, Induration, Duration, Duration adverse effects, adverse effect, No adverse effect, Activity, Activity, Activity hypotension, Hypotension, hypotensin, vomiting, Vomiting, nausea, dysrhythmia, S-T changes carbetocin, single, singlet elective cesarean delivery, contractions, contractions, uterine, studies uterine, Indifference, No difference carbetocin Atrial standards, Standard, Standard, Findings description, prescription, prescription continuous infusion, administration, Readministration, Dpt administration, Mmr administration, administration sets, Maladministrations, oral administration, self administration, Drug administration, drug administration, oxytocin, oxytocic, Oxytocin, Oxytocin, regimen, regimen, required, required side effect, Activity, Activity, Activity Carbetocin, single, singlet side effect, oxytocin, oxytocic, Oxytocin, Oxytocin, studies Blood loss, Blood loss, drugs carbetocin, groups carbetocin study carbetocin, uterine elective cesarean delivery, study, blind study criteria, Eligibility Criteria Elective cesarean delivery, spinal anesthesia, Spinal anesthesia kit study, informed consent form Term pregnancy Criteria informed consent form Allergy., Hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity types, hypersensitivity; drug, food hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity tests, milk hypersensitivity, Skin hypersensitivity, Oral hypersensitivity, Tooth hypersensitivity, Light hypersensitivity, Scalp hypersensitivity, Other hypersensitivity, latex hypersensitivity, wheat hypersensitivity, pain; hypersensitivity, carbetocin, oxytocin, oxytocic, Oxytocin, Oxytocin, Allergy, Allergy, Allergy Postpartum hemorrhage, NOS, H/O: postpartum hemorrhage, Atonic postpartum hemorrhage, Delayed postpartum hemorrhage, uterine atony, Condition, Conditioned multiple gestation, Other multiple gestation, placenta previa, Preeclampsia, eclampsia, macrosomia, Macrosomia uterine fibroids, polyhydramnios, uterine atony, history, history bleeding diathesis, Bleeding diathesis, bleeding vascular diseases, perivascular disease, muscular diseases, Macrovascular disease, Ocular disease, Cardiovascular disease, Renal vascular disease, Hepatic, renal "}
