{"text": "TITLE:\n      Rosiglitazone Versus Placebo in Chronic Stable Angina\nSUMMARY:\n      We wish to see if the drug rosiglitazone, currently used in the treatment of type 2\n      diabetes, could be used as a new treatment for angina when compared with placebo in\n      overweight subjects who do not have overt diabetes. The drug will be given for 3 months and\n      the subjects will be have their angina tested, by way of exercise testing, angina quality of\n      life questionnaire and 24-hour ECG monitoring before and after using the drug.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Chronic stable angina is a common manifestation of ischaemic heart disease. Current\n      mechanical therapies (percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass\n      grafting) and pharmacological therapies (nitrates, calcium channel blockers, betablockers\n      and potassium channel activators) main actions are to treat the end product of ischaemic\n      heart disease on chronic stable angina, i.e. the flow limiting stenosis. We postulate that\n      by treating insulin resistance, an upstream factor in the pathogenesis of ischaemic heart\n      disease, we will improve angina by in turn improving endothelial function. We will attempt\n      to demonstrate this by way of full bruce protocol exercise tolerance test, Seattle Angina\n      Questionnaire and 24 hour ST segment analysis before and after treatment with the insulin\n      sensitiser rosiglitazone for three months.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Chronic stable angina - to see if this improves\n          -  Previous positive exercise tolerance test - to ensure that repeating it yields a\n             result\n          -  Disease not suitable for coronary intervention (Coronary artery bypass grafting or\n             angioplasty) - so that best routine care is not withheld\n          -  Do not have overt diabetes - work on this is being undertaken elsewhere\n          -  Body mass index (BMI) greater than 25\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Diabetes mellitus - see above\n          -  Liver failure (ALT>70U/l, AST>80U/l)\n          -  Renal failure (creatinine > 130mmol/l)\n          -  Cardiac failure - rosiglitazone is contraindicated in those with NYHA 3 and 4 cardiac\n             failure\n          -  Physical disability - if it precludes treadmill testing\n          -  Women of child bearing capacity\n          -  Breast feeding mothers\n", "cuis": "C0340288 C0289313 C0032042 C1552616 C1706244 C0289313 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0013227 C1254351 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0032042 C0002962 C2024883 C1578513 C0497406 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C3244317 C0013227 C1254351 C1561542 C0015260 C0002962 C2024883 C0392366 C0228018 C0180580 C0034394 C1706422 C0815327 C0013227 C1254351 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0010054 C0151744 C1313980 C1510446 C0264694 C0848343 C0340288 C0002965 C1547296 C1555457 C3245511 C0015411 C0010055 C1260596 C0371563 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0087111 C0005527 C2717877 C0018787 C0699886 C0006684 C0872271 C0005116 C0087111 C0005527 C2717877 C1961139 C2112878 C1552007 C0040597 C0022116 C0340288 C0018799 C2186266 C1261287 C0021655 C0699748 C0018787 C0022116 C0031843 C1705273 C0012634 C0018609 C0002962 C2024883 C0541749 C0015260 C1304755 C0162521 C2024889 C0420798 C2709256 C0442713 C0002962 C2926611 C0034394 C1706422 C3641009 C0429029 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0021641 C3537244 C0002778 C0289313 C1561542 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0340288 C0002965 C1547296 C1555457 C0015260 C1304755 C0162521 C2024889 C0420798 C2709256 C1514241 C0010055 C1260596 C0396756 C3698425 C0396767 C0396777 C0396783 C0396789 C0886296 C1948041 C2183254 C1273869 C2979881 C0018787 C0012634 C0162577 C1548817 C0580931 C0011849 C0011860 C0011847 C0005893 C1305855 C0231255 C0231254 C2724372 C0243161 C0011849 C1313937 C0085605 C0035078 C1963154 C0001623 C0201975 C1561535 C0018801 C0018802 C0023212 C1276371 C0289313 C0018787 C1444657 C0421315 C1273094 C0520817 C2242843 C3841881 C2107089 C0392366 C0809418 C0871472 C0006147 C1623040 C1623041 C3539125 ", "concepts": "Chronic Stable Angina, Rosiglitazone, Placebo summary, summary rosiglitazone, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, drug, drug Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes, placebo, anginas, angina, new overweight, Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes, given, drug, drug, month exercise testing, anginas, angina, tested, teste ECG monitoring, questionnaire, Questionnaires, NET questionnaire, drug, drug description, prescription, prescription ischaemic heart disease, Ischemic heart disease, FH: Ischaemic heart disease, Acute ischaemic heart disease, Chronic ischaemic heart disease, Subacute ischaemic heart disease, stable angina, Unstable angina, Chronic, Chronic, common, eye manifestation Coronary artery bypass graft, coronary artery graft bypass, Coronary artery bypass/reop, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, therapies, Biotherapies, Apitherapies, coronary, Mechanical calcium channel blocker, sodium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers bepridil, therapies, Biotherapies, Apitherapies, grafting potassium + channel activators, action, Tractions, ischaemia chronic stable angina, heart disease, FHx heart disease, stenosis insulin resistance, pathogenesis, heart, ischaemia function, Function, disease, h disease, anginas, angina, turn Exercise tolerance test NOS, Exercise tolerance test, Exercise tolerance, exercise tolerance, Exercise tolerance test done, Exercise tolerance, bruce protocol, Angina, Angina questionnaires, Questionnaires, LTE Questionnaire, ST segment, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, insulin, Insulins, Analysis rosiglitazone, month criteria, Eligibility Criteria stable angina, Unstable angina, Chronic, Chronic Exercise tolerance test NOS, Exercise tolerance test, Exercise tolerance, exercise tolerance, Exercise tolerance test done, Exercise tolerance, Positive Coronary artery bypass grafting (procedure), coronary artery bypass graft, Coronary artery bypass graft x 1, Coronary artery bypass grafting planned, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 2, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 3, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 4, Coronary artery bypass grafts x 5, interventions, Intervention, interventional, Interventions, Interventions, coronary, Disease angioplasty, Angioplasty, care Diabetes, diabetes, Diabetes body mass index, Body mass index, NOS, Body mass index low, Body mass index high, Body mass index docd Criteria Diabetes mellitus, NOS, FH: Diabetes mellitus Liver failure Renal failure NOS, Renal failure, Adrenal failure, Creatinine, Creatinine Cardiac failure NOS, Cardiac failures, Cardiac failure left, No cardiac failure, rosiglitazone, cardiac, Contraindicated, HRT contraindicated, OCP contraindicated Physical disability, physical disability, A physical disability, treadmill, testing, q testing, t testing breast feeding, Breast feeding, Breast feeding, others "}
