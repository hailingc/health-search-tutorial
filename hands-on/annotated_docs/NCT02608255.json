{"text": "TITLE:\n      A Prospective Pilot Study to Evaluate a New Marker of Ischemia in Chest Pain Triage\nSUMMARY:\n      A Single-center prospective pilot study enrolling chest pain patients. CD 26 measurement\n      will be performed and compared to troponin \u00b5s for early triage of these patients. This novel\n      biomarker of myocardial ischemia (CD26) will be measured at the time of first medical\n      contact (T0) and after 30 min simultaneously o troponin Ic.\n      All patients aged over 18 years with chest pain which may be related to acute coronary\n      syndrome requiring pre hospital medical contact through the Emergency Medical Service.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      First objectives: demonstrating the early positivity of CD26 compared to ultra-sensitive\n      troponin.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Subject with compatible symptoms with an acute coronary syndrome, for at least 15\n             minutes and not older than 3 hours (eg discomfort, tightness or chest pain, pain\n             radiating to the left arm or two arms, pain in the jaw, pain in the back / neck /\n             stomach, breathlessness , cold sweats, nausea / vomiting , dizziness )\n          -  Man or woman,\n          -  Patient Did not receive heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH ) before the\n             initial blood sample ,\n          -  Patient Agreeing to participate in the study and who signed an informed consent\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Minor or major patient trust\n          -  Patient Not having signed informed consent (refusal , physical or mental disability\n             ... )\n          -  Patient Who received anticoagulation before carrying blood samples\n          -  Patient With a progressive septic processes , neoplasia undergoing treatment,\n             dialyzed kidney failure, a history of surgery or coronary angioplasty less than six\n             months.\n          -  Transplanted heart, renal or hepatic\n          -  heart attack\n          -  Subject Whose symptoms clearly eliminates acute coronary syndrome ( penetrating\n             trauma, traumatic injury by crushing ... )\n          -  Patient Died between the time of inclusion and arrival in the cardiology intensive\n             care ( SIC )\n          -  Patient Withdrawing consent under study\n", "cuis": "C0008031 C0220825 C0022116 C0005516 C3872476 C2745888 C0040861 C0947630 C1552616 C1706244 C0008031 C2926613 C1549113 C0723338 C0947630 C0017231 C0201973 C0202113 C0202123 C0202165 C0202231 C0040861 C2193430 C0679622 C1141947 C0523952 C0010054 C0151744 C0474714 C0474715 C0919693 C0746731 C0340291 C0474713 C2957453 C2957454 C0005516 C3245509 C3842955 C1141947 C0008031 C2926613 C0018787 C0233492 C0445356 C0013961 C0039082 C0206064 C0796095 C0796110 C2936859 C2936904 C3245509 C0259945 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0018017 C2239270 C0728475 C0724054 C0020517 C1141947 C0523952 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0948089 C1457887 C2364135 C0234215 C0008031 C2926613 C0030193 C1555709 C1948032 C0886384 C0236000 C0230347 C1268256 C0446516 C0030193 C0027530 C2137077 C0013404 C0425446 C0232431 C0012833 C0042571 C1963093 C0042963 C1963281 C0038351 C0027497 C0019139 C0522864 C2185960 C2733531 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0019134 C0770546 C0178913 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1561610 C2090600 C0947630 C0009797 C0243161 C1306341 C4055040 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1561610 C2090600 C0009797 C0518505 C0522772 C1548746 C0031809 C1509143 C3272557 C0003281 C2917212 C3537050 C0178913 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0555047 C0027651 C1882062 C0017185 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C3839460 C0002997 C0190211 C1299451 C0396798 C0035078 C0262926 C2004062 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0180409 C1561542 C0040744 C1279380 C0205054 C0022646 C0027051 C0948089 C1457887 C3714660 C3263723 C0185060 C0040461 C1546566 C1456399 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0011065 C1306577 C1546956 C0580931 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0947630 ", "concepts": "Chest Pain, Evaluate, Ischemia, Marker, Marker, Markers, Triage, Study summary, summary chest pain, Chest pain, Single, Singlet, study, ID measurement, CK measurement, LD measurement, LH measurement, pH measurement, T4 measurement triage, triage, novel, t troponin, Troponin myocardial ischaemia, myocardial ischaemia, EKG myocardial ischemia, ECG myocardial ischemia, Endocardial ischemia, Acute myocardial ischemia, Silent myocardial ischemia, ECG no myocardial ischemia, demand myocardial ischemia, myocardial ischemia supply, biomarker contact, <30 min, t troponin chest pain, Chest pain, coronary, elated, Unrelated Emergency Medical Service, syndrome, syndrome X, syndrome c, W syndrome, N syndrome, G syndrome, contact, care hospital description, prescription, prescription objective, objective, ultra, ultram, Sensitive t troponin, Troponin criteria, Eligibility Criteria acute coronary syndrome, symptoms discomforts, Discomfort, chest pain, Chest pain, pain, folder, Folder, 5 minutes pain in jaw, left arm, Left arm, arms, pain, neck, neck breathlessness, No breathlessness, cold sweats, Dizziness, dizziness, Dizziness, vomiting, Vomiting, stomach, nausea lmwh, Low molecular weight heparin assay, low molecular weight (LMW) heparins, Low molecular weight heparin therapy, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, heparins, heparin blood sample Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, signed, signed:, study, informed consent form Criteria mental disability, Total disability, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, signed, signed:, informed consent form, shaving, shaving, Shaving, Physical, Physical, Physical anticoagulation, Anticoagulation, Anticoagulation, blood samples, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, marrying neoplasias, Neoplasia, GI neoplasia, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Nonprogressive coronary angioplasty, Coronary angioplasty, NOS, post coronary angioplasty, Laser coronary angioplasty, kidney failure, history, history, surgery, surgery, surgery:, dialyzer month Transplanted heart, Transplanted heart, hepatic, renal heart attack acute coronary syndrome, symptoms trauma, trauma, Crushing, Brushing, Brushing, Crushing Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Died, Died, Died care Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, study "}
