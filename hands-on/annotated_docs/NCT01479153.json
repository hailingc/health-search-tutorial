{"text": "TITLE:\n      Venous Site for Central Catheterization\nSUMMARY:\n      Central venous catheters are needed in the critical care setting to administer drugs. Three\n      sites are available to gain vascular access: subclavian, internal jugular and femoral. Each\n      site has complications, but there is no randomized controlled study which compared the 3\n      sites.\n      The investigators hypothesis is that subclavian catheterization reduces the risk of major\n      complications compared to internal jugular or femoral.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patient admitted in the Intensive Care Unit\n          -  Requiring Central Venous Catheterization\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Patients with only one site available\n", "cuis": "C0007435 C0042449 C1515974 C1546778 C1552616 C1706244 C0745442 C0010337 C0719205 C1879652 C0013227 C3887804 C0750138 C0042371 C0280956 C0015811 C3244072 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0947630 C0282440 C0007430 C0191117 C2025500 C2025504 C0398266 C0770826 C0009566 C1171258 C0802632 C0161768 C0236167 C1148100 C0015811 C3244072 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0085559 C0184666 C0809949 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C2347274 C0007435 C0975431 C1145640 C0243161 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 ", "concepts": "Central Catheterization, Venous, Site, Site summary, summary venous catheters, critical care, Central, Central -, drugs, upsetting vascular access, vascular access port, poor vascular access, femoral, internalId Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, study, randomized controlled trial catheterization, IVC catheterization, IVC catheterization, SVC catheterization, vein catheterization, catheterization kits Complications, complications, Complications, complications iud, complications iud, NB complication, femoral, internalId criteria, Eligibility Criteria Intensive Care, admitted, Admitted, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Unit Central Venous Catheterization, Central Venous Catheterization Kits, Central Venous Catheter Criteria Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient "}
