{"text": "TITLE:\n      Observational Study With Prospective and/or Retrospective Follow-up, Without Modifying Patient Treatment and Follow-up Practices for the Initial Treatment of Hypothyroidism in France\nSUMMARY:\n      This observational survey with prospective and/or retrospective follow-up is designed to\n      study practices for the initial treatment of hypothyroidism in France without modifying\n      subject treatment.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Thyroid disorder can be central, caused by a deficiency in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)\n      production; or peripheral, caused by the decrease in the plasma concentration of thyroid\n      hormones, more specifically of free thyroxine (free T4). Peripheral hypothyroidism is caused\n      by the decrease in the production capacities of the thyroid gland.\n      The treatment of hypothyroidism is based on the restoration and maintenance of biological\n      (judged on the basis of the standardised TSH and T4 values) and clinical euthyroidism.\n      A number of forms of thyroid hormones are available in the French market (Euthyral\u00ae,\n      Cynomel\u00ae, L-thyroxine drops\u00ae), of which, Levothyrox\u00ae is the most frequently prescribed drug\n      in this category.\n      The treatment of peripheral hypothyroidism, in particular, is well codified and almost\n      consensual. In France, there is no published observational study, based on which one can\n      document the manner in which subjects are treated. This observational study is set up to\n      document these practices.\n      OBJECTIVES The principal objectives of this survey is to to get information on the use of\n      Levothyrox in France\n        -  Circumstances of diagnosis\n        -  Record realised\n        -  Terms and conditions of treatment by the general practitioner and/or the\n           endocrinologist\n      The secondary objective is to evaluate the inclusion criteria for levothyroxine treatment.\n      For each subject the participating doctor will complete a follow up questionnaire form until\n      the first control level of TSH after the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  Recently diagnosed hypothyroid subject (either during the inclusion period, or within\n             the 6 previous months) for whom, data related to the diagnosis is available if the\n             diagnosis was not carried out initially by the investigating doctor\n          -  Subject, who has given his/her oral consent for participation\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  Subject included in clinical trial or having participated in a clinical trial during\n             the last 3 months\n          -  Subject presenting a major and objectifiable risk of not being able to follow-up\n             until the next TSH level (moving, problems encountered during another study,\n             pathology affecting the vital prognosis in the short-term)\n          -  All contraindications to L\u00e9vothyrox\n", "cuis": "C0020676 C0577643 C1964257 C0557985 C0700325 C0087111 C1533734 C3887704 C0746919 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C1719822 C0947630 C0237607 C1552616 C1706244 C0038951 C1964257 C0478530 C0700325 C0020676 C0455486 C0237607 C3245512 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0947630 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0040160 C0696098 C0202230 C0428414 C0853130 C0857986 C0857722 C0858305 C1406950 C0586553 C0040128 C0455366 C0162044 C0020621 C0032827 C0162429 C0034341 C0268125 C1971019 C3150275 C3151082 C0086045 C0004268 C0549409 C0854379 C0040132 C0040134 C2228489 C0076638 C0117002 C0032105 C0035150 C1548180 C3156621 C0020676 C0455486 C0040165 C0079691 C0202231 C1281902 C0202225 C0040132 C0496941 C1278878 C0030518 C0153653 C0154041 C0496943 C0035150 C1548180 C3156621 C0020676 C0455486 C0449982 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C1548762 C3272559 C1848783 C0117002 C3272565 C0059912 C0040132 C0040134 C2228489 C0076638 C0117002 C0079691 C0040165 C1450020 C1881373 C0733849 C0278329 C0013227 C1254351 C0013604 C3882767 C0683312 C0456532 C0456533 C1275857 C0020676 C0455486 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0947630 C1964257 C0478530 C0700325 C1704324 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C1548385 C1301725 C1609436 C0947630 C0036849 C1964257 C0478530 C0700325 C0332155 C0237607 C3245512 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C1548385 C1301725 C1609436 C0018017 C2239270 C0038951 C3242430 C1561528 C1450020 C0040165 C1881373 C0733849 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0034869 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0012634 C2735115 C0040165 C1881373 C0027627 C0018017 C2239270 C2979883 C0087111 C3887704 C0376495 C1533734 C0746919 C0814472 C3647788 C0243161 C0220825 C0034394 C1706422 C0815327 C1815293 C0020676 C0455486 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0020676 C0011900 C1408353 C0025344 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C3245479 C0233492 C0445356 C1561542 C0011900 C0945731 C0551521 C0552426 C0560182 C0686906 C0679838 C0699809 C3244317 C0243161 C1096775 C0518505 C0522772 C1548746 C1561542 C1299581 C0202230 C0202022 C0455276 C0474670 C0560560 C0947630 C0033213 C2081614 C1512346 C0677042 C0919386 C0033325 C3854082 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C1450020 ", "concepts": "Hypothyroidism, NOS, FH: Hypothyroidism, Observational, Observation, Observation, treatment, Treatment, treatment, No Treatment, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Patient, Follow, Study, Practice summary, summary survey, Observational, observation, observation hypothyroidism, H/O: hypothyroidism, practice, practice, Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment, study Treatment, treatment, Retreatment, Treatment, no treatment, co-treatment, maltreatment description, prescription, prescription thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroid stimulate hormone, Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid stimulating hormone level, Blood thyroid stimulating hormone, Serum thyroid stimulating hormone, Plasma thyroid stimulating hormone, Thyroid stimulating hormone normal, thyroid stimulating;
