{"text": "TITLE:\n      Trial of a Cardiac Rehabilitation Program Delivered Remotely Through the Internet\nSUMMARY:\n      Cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRP) are a proven treatment for those with ischemic heart\n      disease (IHD). These programs have been demonstrated to improve adherence to regular\n      physical activity, a healthy diet and smoking cessation, as well as modify risk factors for\n      IHD such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity and type 2 diabetes. In addition,\n      CRP are cost effective and can result in a 25% reduction in reoccurrence of mortality.\n      Despite the known benefits of CRP, as little as 10% to 25% of eligible patients attend these\n      programs. One of the main barriers to attendance is proximity to a CRP, as the majority of\n      these programs are limited to hospitals in large urban areas. However, cardiovascular\n      diseases do not discriminate by geography, resulting in a geographic inequity of care for\n      patients living in rural, remote and smaller urban/sub-urban centres. Currently there are no\n      CRP specifically designed for patients in rural and remote areas. The use of the Internet\n      may present itself as a viable alternative. We have recently completed a pilot study of a\n      virtual CRP (vCRP) that demonstrated significant improvements in exercise capacity and risk\n      factors. This investigation will study the vCRP in a group of IHD patients who do not have\n      access to hospital-based CRP.\n      Hypotheses A. Participation in a 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program will\n      result in significant improvements in exercise capacity compared to usual care, in patients\n      with diagnosed IHD.\n      B. Participation in a 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program will result in\n      significant improvements in exercise capacity after one year compared to usual care, in\n      patients with diagnosed IHD.\n      Study Population Men and women over 18 years will be identified from consecutive in-patients\n      of the British Columbia Provincial Heart Centre at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver who\n      reside in either the Northern Interior or Coast Garibaldi health areas. Patients will be\n      eligible if they have IHD, Internet access, no previous experience with cardiac\n      rehabilitation and no physical limitations to exercise. A total of 74 patients (37 per\n      group) will be recruited and randomized to either usual care, or a 4 month 'virtual' cardiac\n      rehabilitation program delivered via the Internet.\n      Usual Care Group Patients randomized to usual care will be provided with simple guidelines\n      for safe exercising and healthy eating habits, and return to the care of their primary care\n      physician. Patients will return at 4 and 16 months later for outcome assessment. There will\n      be no contact between the study personnel and usual care patients for the duration of the\n      study, nor will there be any attempt to control the level of patient care.\n      Intervention The vCRP has been developed to mimic hospital-based CRP and includes online\n      intake forms, one-on-one chat sessions with vCRP nurse, dietitian and exercise specialist,\n      data collection (exercise heart rate, blood pressure, glucose- if diabetic), peer-support\n      group chat sessions, ask-an-expert chat sessions, education, progress reports and online\n      resources. Upon randomization to the intervention, patients will receive access to the\n      website, a heart rate monitor and a blood pressure monitor and trained in their use. The\n      heart rate monitors allow for exercise heart rate data to be stored and downloaded to their\n      home computer and then uploaded to the vCRP webserver. The exercise data will be reviewed\n      weekly. A letter to the patient's primary care physician will be sent to outline the vCRP\n      intervention, the treatment algorithms to be used and indicate under what circumstances the\n      vCRP nurse and/or patient may contact them with regards to their management. Patients will\n      receive one-on-one counselling by the nurse, dietitian and exercise specialist via chat\n      sessions at 3 to 4 week intervals. After the 4 month intervention, patients will be\n      discharged into the care of their primary care physician.\n      Outcomes Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4 and 16 months for risk factors and\n      lifestyle behaviours. The primary outcomes will be the change in exercise capacity as\n      between the two groups from baseline to 4 months, and from baseline to 16 months. Exercise\n      capacity will be assessed as total time on a symptom-limited exercise stress test.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          1. Men and women admitted for an IHD event (acute coronary syndrome or revascularization\n             procedure) who are at low or moderate risk.91\n          2. Regular Internet access (home, work or other environment).\n          3. Over 18 years of age.\n          4. Permission of the attending physician.\n          5. Able to read, write and understand English without difficulty.\n          6. No physical limitations to regular activity.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          1. Previous experience with a cardiac rehabilitation program.\n          2. Patients with depression, uncontrolled diabetes and other significant co-morbidities\n             that may interfere with effective IHD management.\n          3. Those patients, who in the mind of the attending physician, are unsuitable for\n             participation.\n          4. Those unable to provide informed consent.\n          5. Pregnant women.\n          6. High-risk patients for safety considerations (future studies will include high-risk\n             patients).\n", "cuis": "C0700431 C0687240 C0150497 C2728259 C0376691 C1966209 C1552616 C1706244
