{"text": "TITLE:\n      Use of Amplified Sound Signal to Identify Presence of Carotid and Femoral Stenosis\nSUMMARY:\n      The purpose of the study is to test a new amplified stethoscope(AudioDoc) that can detect\n      the presence of bruit by using an acoustic signal to represent the bruit. This pilot study\n      will address two questions: is there a detectable difference in recorded sound signal of\n      carotid and femoral bruit when compared to sound signals captured when there is no bruit\n      present; is the use of a visual recorded signal more accurate in identifying carotid and\n      femoral bruit when compared to traditional auscultation with a regular stethoscope and\n      ultrasound.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      Recorded signals are stored on a laptop computer. The signals later undergo Fourier analysis\n      are then compared to the findings on carotid ultrasoud as to degree of stenosis. Subjects\n      with high grade stenosis in which no bruit was ascultated but in which carotid ultrasound\n      data suggests a bruit may be present are studied for soft /inaudible bruits. When available,\n      data will be correlated to CT/conventional angiographic studies.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          -  age 19-90 years\n          -  having clinical ultrasound evaluation of carotid or femoral artery\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          -  under age 19; over age 90 years\n", "cuis": "C0392148 C1261287 C0741968 C0015811 C0175663 C1947944 C1710083 C1706099 C1552616 C1706244 C0442726 C0947630 C0392366 C0456984 C1578513 C0392148 C0006318 C0947630 C3827727 C3830527 C0085632 C3842396 C0182913 C0376649 C0558799 C0741968 C0006318 C0741968 C0182913 C0558799 C0004339 C0183559 C0041618 C2368378 C0412555 C3525387 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0182913 C1705115 C0002778 C1261287 C0741968 C0542560 C2926606 C0041618 C2368378 C0412555 C3525387 C1261287 C0741968 C3244287 C0286840 C0006318 C0006318 C3245479 C0947630 C3245479 C0442842 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C0015801 C1280173 C0226448 C1281581 C0226455 C0041618 C2368378 C0412555 C3525387 C0220825 C1261322 C1444296 C1444299 C0741968 C0518505 C0522772 C1548746 C3272565 C0243161 ", "concepts": "Presence, Stenosis, Carotid, Femoral, Sound, Use, SignalP, Amplifier summary, summary detect, study, test, test, new presence, bruit, study Undetectable, Detectable, Indifference, No difference, recorder, addresses femoral bruit, carotid, bruit carotid, recorder femoral bruit, auscultation, stethoscope ultrasounds, ultrasound, ob ultrasound, 3D ultrasound description, prescription, prescription Recorder, Recorder, Analysis stenosis, carotid, degree, Findings ultrasounds, ultrasound, ob ultrasound, 3D ultrasound, stenosis, carotid, grade, gradex, bruit bruit, data studies, data, Conventional angiography criteria, Eligibility Criteria femoral arteries, Femoral artery, Left femoral artery, Left femoral artery, Deep femoral artery, ultrasounds, ultrasound, ob ultrasound, 3D ultrasound, Evaluation, Evaluation, OT evaluation, Pt evaluation, carotid, shaving, shaving, Shaving, Clinical Criteria "}
