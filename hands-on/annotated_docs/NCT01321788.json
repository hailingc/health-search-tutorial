{"text": "TITLE:\n      Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis Post Cesarean Section\nSUMMARY:\n      Pregnancy is associated with an overall 5-10 fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism\n      (VTE). VTE remains the most common cause of maternal death in the developed world. It is up\n      to 10 times more common in pregnant women than non-pregnant women of comparable age. More\n      than a third of pregnancy-related VTE occurs during the six weeks after delivery. When\n      compared with vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery further increases the risk of pregnancy\n      associated VTE by three-fold.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      This is a double blind- a randomized controlled study of prophylactic LMWH in women at low\n      risk for VTE following a cesarean section procedure. The sample size is 300 patients,\n      Eligible, consenting, and randomized participants will receive once-daily injections of\n      study drug (4,500 IU Tinzaparin Sodium [Innohep\u00ae] within 12- to 24-hours postpartum and\n      continue for two weeks versus Placebo in the other arm and follow for six (6) weeks\n      postpartum.\n      On the day of hospital discharge, bilateral leg imaging with compression, leg ultrasounds,\n      and pelvic vein imaging with MRV will be completed. The primary outcome will be adjudicated,\n      while DVT will be documented on ultrasounds or MRV on the day of hospital discharge.\n      Secondary outcomes will include symptomatic DVT and PE, death from PE, major and minor\n      bleeding, and HIT during the six-week postpartum period. All outcomes will be adjudicated by\n      an independent committee of experts blinded to study drug allocation.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n          1. Age > 18 years old.\n          2. Delivered by cesarean section (emergency or planned).\n          3. Signed, informed consent.\n          4. Ready access to a local health service.\n          5. Capable of using Tinzaparin.\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n          1. at high risk for thromboembolism (any one of the following):\n               -  age more than 35 years old\n               -  obesity (more than 80 kg)\n               -  parity more than 4\n               -  gross varicose veins\n               -  current infection\n               -  pre-eclampsia\n               -  immobility prior to surgery (more than 4 days)\n               -  Major current disease: including heart or lung disease, cancer,inflammatory\n                  bowel disease and nephrotic syndrome.\n               -  Extended major pelvic or abdominal surgery (e.g. cesarean hysterectomy)\n               -  Patients with a family history of VTE\n               -  History of superficial phlebitis\n          2. More than 36 hours since delivery\n          3. Need for anticoagulation, including:\n               -  women with a confirmed thrombophilia\n               -  women with paralysis of lower limbs\n               -  women with personal history of VTE\n               -  women with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLA)\n               -  women with mechanical heart valves\n          4. Contraindication to heparin therapy, including history of heparin induced\n             thrombocytopenia.\n", "cuis": "C0199242 C0007876 C0150166 C0042449 C1552616 C1706244 C0040038 C0455533 C0032961 C3484365 C0425965 C3843687 C3843688 C3843689 C3843690 C3843691 C3843692 C2065082 C0151576 C0151680 C0151872 C0151878 C0221106 C0235986 C0240292 C0520869 C0595879 C0856882 C0861002 C1295665 C1295668 C1858460 C0721591 C3245511 C0011065 C1306577 C2363670 C0549206 C3245511 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0011209 C2053584 C0308779 C1390948 C1314680 C0233492 C0445356 C0007876 C1384674 C0195605 C0195625 C0473294 C0157478 C0566690 C2114516 C1541822 C2094780 C0032961 C1391387 C3484365 C0678257 C0033080 C1521941 C0947630 C0019139 C1550472 C0355642 C0677582 C0009653 C0282440 C0456909 C0007876 C1384674 C0150166 C0475172 C0184661 C0025664 C0944777 C0945766 C1948041 C3538935 C3539779 C0449999 C1144702 C0441621 C0021485 C1533685 C0444600 C0354599 C0591649 C0947630 C0013227 C1254351 C0032042 C0446516 C1140618 C0586003 C0814903 C0488552 C0489550 C0551606 C0488553 C1657769 C0374572 C0374573 C1545499 C0565514 C0021153 C1829459 C4049863 C0041618 C2368378 C0412555 C0079595 C1561538 C1140621 C0226791 C1281330 C0079595 C0586003 C0814903 C0488552 C0489550 C0551606 C0488553 C1657769 C0374572 C0374573 C1545499 C0041618 C2368378 C0412555 C1301725 C1609436 C1301746 C1547673 C1563337 C1561538 C0011065 C1306577 C1446899 C0231221 C0027627 C0019080 C0025344 C1561540 C1299583 C0599749 C0011546 C0439857 C0947630 C0013227 C1254351 C1555588 C1171947 C0243161 C0013893 C0243161 C1114365 C0007876 C1384674 C0150166 C0475172 C1546399 C1553500 C1546844 C2745965 C1519316 C0009797 C0018747 C1552565 C0216278 C0243161 C0040038 C0455533 C0028754 C0030563 C0042345 C3873440 C0155778 C0455534 C0009450 C3714514 C0275524 C0012683 C0035637 C0276041 C0729555 C0747002 C0032914 C0231441 C0425245 C0543467 C1457907 C2081627 C0024115 C2316532 C0012634 C0018609 C0006826 C0260515 C0018787 C0442743 C0003209 C0027726 C0027730 C0027729 C0021831 C0195623 C1442778 C2045008 C0198482 C2062966 C0030797 C0241889 C0332123 C1397163 C1397164 C2584882 C1550655 C1578485 C1578486 C2360836 C2360838 C2360840 C0750876 C0262926 C2004062 C0011209 C2053584 C0308779 C1390948 C1314680 C0003281 C2917212 C3537050 C0398623 C1861171 C0023216 C0153665 C1269079 C0522224 C0262926 C0424945 C0085278 C4019436 C0018829 C0493527 C0184252 C1186983 C1301624 C1547316 C3714732 C0522794 C0262926 C2004062 C0019134 C0770546 C0040034 C0745013 C1839163 C1861185 C2677608 C2678311 C1856453 C2751260 C0919932 C2349596 ", "concepts": "Thromboembolism Prophylaxis, Cesarean Section, Cesarean Section Care, Venous summary, summary thromboembolism, H/O: thromboembolism, pregnancy, Pregnancy, ?
