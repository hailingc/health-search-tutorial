{"text": "TITLE:\n      Carbetocin at Elective Cesarean Delivery Part 2\nSUMMARY:\n      Post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal death worldwide. Oxytocin is the\n      most common uterotonic drug used to prevent and treat PPH in North America, however, there\n      are some limitations to its use. Oxytocin has a very short duration of action, which\n      requires a continuous infusion to achieve sustained uterotonic activity. The Society of\n      Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) has recently recommended a single 100mcg\n      dose of carbetocin at elective Cesarean delivery to promote uterine contraction and prevent\n      post partum hemorrhage (PPH), in lieu of the more traditional oxytocin regimens. Carbetocin\n      lasts 4 to 7 times longer than oxytocin, with a similar side effect profile and apparent\n      greater efficacy rate. However, a dose response to determine the minimum effective dose of\n      carbetocin has not yet been published. The investigators hypothesize that the minimum\n      effective dose (ED90) is above 20mcgs and below 80mcgs in women undergoing elective Cesarean\n      delivery.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n      The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) recently recommended a\n      100mcg intravenous bolus dose of carbetocin following Cesarean delivery.\n      Studies thus far show that carbetocin may be just as effective as oxytocin in promoting\n      uterine contraction, with a similar side effect profile. In addition, patients receiving\n      carbetocin may experience less blood loss, and require less additional uterotonics when\n      compared with oxytocin. A dose response study conducted by Cordovani et al suggested no\n      difference in efficacy of uterine contraction for doses of carbetocin between 80-120mcg.\n      Additionally, hypotension was noted for all dose groups studied.\n      The results of this follow-up study will define the minimum required dose of carbetocin for\n      uterine contraction, thus minimizing unnecessary side effects, improving quality and safety\n      of patient care. It may also contribute in establishing carbetocin as a substitute to\n      oxytocin for elective cesarean section at our institution as well as others.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n      Inclusion
